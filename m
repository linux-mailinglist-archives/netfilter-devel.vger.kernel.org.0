Oh, sorry for the caused inconvenience.

That's correct. I assumed that you added the include for a reason and
it's breaking Nick's use-case, the two of you want to have a word with
each other. :)

With glibc, netinet/ether.h includes netinet/if_ether.h which in turn
includes linux/if_ether.h where finally ETH_ALEN is defined.

In xtables.c we definitely need netinet/ether.h for ether_aton()
declaration.

While I think musl not catching the "double" include is a bug, I'd
prefer the ifdef __BIONIC__ solution since it started the "but my libc
needs this" game.

Nick, if the above change fixes musl builds for you, would you mind
submitting it formally along with a move of the netinet/ether.h include
from mid-file to top?

Thanks, Phil
