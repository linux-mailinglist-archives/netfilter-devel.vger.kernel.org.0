Yes, there are two APIs, same thing occurs in other existing
libnetfilter_* libraries, each of these APIs are based on libnfnetlink
and libmnl respectively.

libnfnetlink will go away sooner or later. We are steadily replacing
all client of this library for netfilter.org projects. Telling that
this is not deprecated without providing a compatible "old API" for
libmnl adds more confusion to this subject.

If you want to explore providing a patch that makes the
libnfnetlink-based API work over libmnl, then go for it.
