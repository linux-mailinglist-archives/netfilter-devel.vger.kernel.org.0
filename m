Ok, listing all tables involved in one commit with deduplication will be
a bit of a nuisance.

Ok, so there could be a stand-alone chain mod with one table, then a
table add of a different one with a "higher ranking" op...

Ah, so it could trigger on generation change.  Would GET ops be included
in any other change, such that it would be desirable to filter them out
to reduce noise in that single log line if it is attempted to list all
the change ops?  It almost sounds like it would be better to do one
audit log line for each table for each family, and possibly for each op
to avoid the need to change userspace.  This would already be a
significant improvement picking the highest ranking op.
