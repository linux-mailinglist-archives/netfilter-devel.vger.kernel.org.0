You mean, someone might forget to update the list of keywords.

That's right.

Autogenerating this list would be good, I didn't good that far in
exploring this.

Or just making a shell script that extracts the %token lines to try to
create table with a keyword as a name.

The shell script would just have a "list of unallowed keyword" to
filter out the %tokens that are not allowed, for those tokens that are
really reserved keywords.

Probably we have to set some explicit restrictions, like table, chain,
rule, set, map and flowtable are reserved keywords. For example, not
allowing to call a table '>'. That was not possible since the
beginning anyway.

The concern is to add a new token and break backward as it happened
with 'dynamic' as Florian reported I think.

BTW, Florian mentioned your patch makes unhappy the tests infra?
What's the issue?
