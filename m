I don't think it is worth the update, maybe some simplification to
remove silly things such as Makefile.am with one singleton line, but
there are better things to look at IMO.

CI is what is missing, a single run is proving not giving much in
return these days after your improvements.

The recent bugs that were uncovered have been spotted by running this
is a loop, and also exercising standalone 30s-stress from Florian for
many hours.

A few minutes does not harm (I can check how long it takes on my AMD
Epyc box that I use for testing), but CI might provide more reliable
information on what is going on.

Thanks.
