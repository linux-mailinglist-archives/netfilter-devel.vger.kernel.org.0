I think the change is OK if existing rulesets will continue to
work just as before and remain compatible with legacy. IMHO, new
rulesets created using iptables-nft may become incompatible if users
explicitly ask for it (e.g. by specifying an exceedingly long log
prefix.

What about --nflog-range? This series seems to drop support for it, at
least in the sense that ruleset dumps won't contain the option. In
theory, users could depend on identifying a specific rule via nflog
range value.

Cheers, Phil
