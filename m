Series LGTM, applied.

The ugly macro can go away later, once meta_parse_key() is removed
when bison/flex use start conditions for this, and probably log prefix
is reviewed not to use it anymore. I still think that macro is not
looking any better after this update but this is not a deal breaker
for this series.

BTW, would you extend tests/build to check for run build tests for
clang in a follow up patch? That would help a lot to improve coverage,
and reduce chances compilation with clang breaks again in the future
before a release.

Thanks.
