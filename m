Hello Mikhail,

sorry for the delayed response;
I am very happy to see activity on this patch set! :)

That is a good observation which I had missed.

I agree with your analysis, I also see the main use case of socket()
restrictions in:

 (a) restricting socket creating altogether
 (b) only permitting socket types for which there is fine grained control

and I also agree that it would be very surprising when the same socket type=
s
that provide fine grained control would also open the door for unrestricted
access to SMC, SCTP or other protocols.  We should instead strive for a
socket() access control with which these additional protocols weren't
accessible.

So adding "protocol" to the rule attributes would suffice to restrict the u=
se of
SMC and SCTP then?  (Sorry, I lost context on these protocols a bit in the
meantime, I was so far under the impression that these were using different
values for family and type than TCP and UDP do.)

Whether the user is adding one rule to permit AF_INET+*, or whether the use=
r is
adding two rules to permit (1) AF_INET+SOCK_STREAM and (2) AF_INET+SOCK_DGR=
AM,
that does not seem like a big deal to me as long as the list of such
combinations is so low?

I see that this is a longer switch statement that maps to this enum, it wou=
ld be
an additional data table that would have to be documented separately for us=
ers.

Do you have an example for how such a "security class enum" would map to th=
e
combinations of family, type and socket for the protocols discussed above?

If this is just a matter of actually mapping (family, type, protocol)
combinations in a more flexible way, could we get away by allowing a specia=
l
"wildcard" value for the "protocol" field, when it is used within a ruleset=
?
Then the LSM would have to look up whether there is a rule for (family, typ=
e,
protocol) and the only change would be that it now needs to also check whet=
her
there is a rule for (family, type, *)?
