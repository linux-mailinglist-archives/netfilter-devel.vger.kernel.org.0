We should indeed include the protocol type in the rule definition.

It looks like SOCK_TYPE_MASK is not part of UAPI, which means it could
change with kernel versions (even while being in UAPI in fact).  This
new socket creation control should allow to deny any socket creation
known or unknow at the time of the user space program build, and
whatever the available C headers.

This also means that Landlock should accept any domain, type, and
protocols defined in rules.  Indeed, we don't want to reject rules for
which some protocols are not allowed.

What about using bitmasks for the domain and type fields (renamed to
"domains" and "types")?  The last protocol is currently 45/MCTP so a
64-bit field is enough, and 10/SOCK_PACKET also fits for the last socket
type.

We cannot do the same with the protocol because the higher one is
262/MPTCP though.  But it looks like a value of 0 (default protocol)
should be enough for most use cases, and users could specify a protocol
(but this time as a number, not a bitmask).

To sum up, we could have something like this:

  const struct landlock_socket_attr create_socket_attr = {
  	.allowed_access = LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE,
  	.families = 1 << AF_INET | 1 << AF_INET6,
  	.types = 1 << SOCK_STREAM,
  	.protocol = IPPROTO_SCTP
  };

I also agree, but this might change if users have to set a combination
of families, types, and protocols.  This should be OK with the bitmask
approach though.

The mapping looks good indeed, and it has been tested for a long time
with many applications.  However, this would make the kernel
implementation more complex, and I think this mapping could easily be
implemented in user space libraries with the bitmask approach, if really
needed, which I'm not sure.
