Hi, sorry for the delay.

Actually, also this kind of overlap is detected (and already covered by
testcases). Here, we would notice already while inserting 'x' that it
sits between non-matching existing start, x, and existing end, y.

This can't be detected with just local considerations, and it's the
reason why the 'overlap' flag is updated as we descend the tree. Now,
the issue mentioned below:
	https://bugzilla.netfilter.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1449

comes from a wrong assumption I took, namely, the fact that as end
elements are always inserted after start elements, they also need to be
found in the tree as descendants of start elements.

This isn't true with tree rebalancing operations resulting in
rotations, and in the case reported we have some delete operations
triggering that.

I fixed this case in a new series I'm posting, together with additional
tests that cause different types of rotations, and one fix for a false
negative case instead, that I found while playing around with nft
(skipping different types of overlap checks while keeping others in
place).

Now, I couldn't find a way to insert anonymous sets that would trigger
(partial) overlap detection. This is because those overlaps are already
handled (by merging) by nft, and if I insert multiple anonymous sets
with overlapping intervals, they are, well... different sets, so
anything goes. Let me know if I'm missing something here.
