Add a "bool incomplete" to libnftnl strnct nftnl_expr, then set it
from each expr->parse callback if there is a new netlink attribute that
we did not understand.

nft then checks if this is incomplete-marker is set.

Yes, for attributes that libnftnl knows about but where nft lacks a name
mapping (i.e., we can decode its META_KEY 0x42 but we have no idea what
that means we could in fact add such a representation scheme.

Yes.  Perhaps its better to consider adding a new tool (script?) that
can dump the netlink soup without interpretation.  IIRC libmnl debug
already provides this functionality.

Very chatty but it would be good enough to figure out what such
hypothetical raw client did.

Right.

Well, I don't think we can do that.  Perhaps with a new tool
that allows to assemble raw expressions, but I'm not sure its worth
extending nft for this, the parser (and grammar) is already huge.

For cases where libnftnl is fine but nft lacks a human-readable name I
think such @meta,42 would be fine.

But I don't think its good to allow decoding something arbitary, I think
we would have to acknowledge that this can't be done unless you have
a textual parser for raw netlink descriptions (i.e., full/unreadable TLV soup).
