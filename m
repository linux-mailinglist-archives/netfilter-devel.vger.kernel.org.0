Yes, the goal was to avoid changes in output given typical /etc/protocol
contents - it prefers "ipv6-icmp" over "icmpv6" for protocol 58 at least
on my systems.

I would suggest to not rely upon human-readable names for protocol
numbers, but in fact there's no way out: iptables consolidates its
internal protocol names list even if --numeric was given.

Another bug I found while playing around is this:

| # iptables -A FORWARD -p icmpv6
| # iptables -vnL FORWARD
| Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
|  pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
|     0     0            ipv6-icmp--  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0

print_rule_details() does not append a space after the protocol name if it is
longer or equal to five characters.

Both bugs seem to exist since day 1, I'm still tempted to fix them, i.e.:

- Print protocol numbers with --numeric
- Adjust the protocol format string from "%-5s" to "%-4s " for protocol
  names and from "%-5hu" to "%-4hu " for protocol numbers to force a
  single white space

Objections anyone?

Thanks, Phil
