I think you'r right, the 'clear the leftover' is only correct if
we hit cb->args[0] >= htable_size condition.
OTOH reverting it gives the problem that commit fixed.

So I think that this code is just way too complicated,
i have no idea why this ever used reference counts, they do not buy
anything but headaches.

Maybe, but even if this code would just store the address, the probability
of a recycle happening in such a way that a conntrack oject happens to be
stored, and then on next dump got re-added at exactly this slot is
almost 0.

And even if it would have been, the worst that can happen is that we
dump another entry a second time.  /proc code uses to walk the entire
table from start, counting dumped-entries and I'm not aware of 'dup'
complaints.

Yes, it considers the tuples for the hash too, so its exteremly
unlikely for a recycle to result in same u32 hash value.
