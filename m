The IPv6 subnet has more IPs than the internal transfer IPv4 network.
Therefore doing a NAT66 to condense all of them into one IPv6 address
means you only need 1 IPv4 in the internal transfer net. Therefore the
limitation stated above no longer applies. Admittedly if you do the
nat44 within a dedicated network namespace while sharing an IPv4 with
the host you'd still need to do NAT44 too.

doesn't k8s also support sctp? Also still no need to just drop
everything else, would have expected to just pass through it without
special handling...
