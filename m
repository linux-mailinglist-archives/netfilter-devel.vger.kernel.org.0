But this should describe netfilter and not something else :-)

Hm, I think "Terminates the evaluation of the chain" is pretty clear.
And "Evaluation continues in ..." is also clear, packet is allowed to
move on in the processing pipeline.

It correct but it sounds overly complicated IMO.

I would be fine with that, even though I also consider it too verbose.

Hmm, I am not sure.  Is it really needed to mention all of this?
Packet will just move on in the pipeline, it would be weird to assume
that forward-accepted packet would e.g. bypass postrouting.

... or that it moes to the next base chain but that base chain ignores
jumps to user-defined chains.

Your suggestions aren't wrong of course but it seems very repetitive to
me.

Thats fine.

Yes, I understand that some people see it that way.

I see netfilter as a pipeline, where packet moves along a certain path,
e.g. prerouting, forward, postrouting or prerouting -> input.

accept is just a "move along", whereas drop stops the packet dead in its
tracks.

nftables is just a "user visible" part that allows to customize
the move-along-or-not decisions.

Hence, this "overrule old decision" idea doesn't apply.

But I can see that others may have a different concept of how
this all works under the hood.

But I have no idea how to best describe this let alone make it
clear that you can't back out of a "drop" decision.

OK, never mind. I have no strong opinion here.

I hope my comments above wrt. netfilter pipeline make sense and answer
this question.

Hmm, I feel there is a need to document the netfilter pipeline better.

Perhaps we should add a netfilter man page document and
ship that too to explain this "move on" thing that accept does behind
the scenes?

Yes, I understand that.

Yes, its not relevant, in eval terms reject and drop are the same.

I wonder where the idea that "accept" is a kind of magic teleporter that
just fast-forwards a packet to the socket or NIC came from...

This isn't the case even in old ipchains.

Correct, it should be in the REJECT STATEMENT section only.

I suggest to send a smaller v3 first, with the less "controversial"
stuff.  Patch 3 seems ready to go for instance.

Then, once thats in, revisit this patch in a (rebased and smaller) v4.

There is nothing wrong with getting this merged in smaller batches
over a longer period.
