Well, I'd say it's a bit more than that, some tests there cover
specific functionalities rather extensively. Still:

...I'm not aware of any (except for ipset cases that actually test both
sides with packets, see http://git.netfilter.org/ipset/tree/tests).

Sure, I think it would be great to have something with actual traffic
at the same level of detail as nft tests, though.
