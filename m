I have verified now again with the same procedure, i.e. build ebtables
2.0.11 without proposed patches or special flags, on following
platforms:

1.  x86_64 kernel 5.4.x + i686 userspace: ebtables works correctly

2.  aarch64 kernel 4.1.x + 32-bit ARM userspace: ebtables fails as describe=
d

As mentioned before, in both cases CONFIG_COMPAT=3Dy .

Yes, iptables 1.8.6 is used successfully without special provisioning
for bitness. We are using Buildroot 2021.02 to compile.

Yes, in the proposed changes to ebtables userspace, this kind of logic
is restored, but not based on the machine type but with an autoconf
flag.

Can you be more specific what you are referring to here?

For the kernel part, a long time ago you already created commit
81e675c227ec60a0bdcbb547dc530ebee23ff931 which is supposed to add
compatibility when CONFIG_COMPAT=3Dy. This code is still present in the
4.1.x I tested above.

So at this moment it seems to me that the kernel compat support is
effectively compiled in, and supports x86(_64) but does not support
the Aarch64/ARM combination (and perhaps others).

How to proceed now?

Thanks,
Thomas
