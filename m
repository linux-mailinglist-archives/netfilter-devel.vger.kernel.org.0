This assertion failure had already been fixed by the bitwise shift
patches you had recently applied.  However, the rule itself doesn't yet
quite work because `tcp dport lshift 1` has the wrong endianness.  Thus
given an original `tcp dport` of 40, we end up with 20480, instead of 80.

After giving this some thought, it occurred to me that this could be
fixed by extending bitwise boolean operations to support a variable
righthand operand (IIRC, before Christmas Florian suggested something
along these lines to me in another, related context), so I've gone down
that route.  Patches to follow shortly.
