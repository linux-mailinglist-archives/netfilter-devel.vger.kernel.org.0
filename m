At some point we do want to move from iptables to nftables, so we do
need to come up with a solution for nft.

I wonder what nft building block we need if we want something like this,
e.g. based on the number of GRO/GSO segments.  We could have an inc_segs
and a greater-than-and-reset (gt_limit / gt_mod) with a counter limit
modifier that wraps increments. Like the C code does, it matches when we
overrun 'nth.every' and resets it back.  For existing iptables code this
is reset to zero, and new code take into account how much we overshot.

No, this is where the "on average" assumption fails.  Packets with many
segments gets statistically under-represented. As far as I'm told people
noticed that the bandwidth estimate based on sampled packets were too
far off (from other correlating stats like interface stats).

I'm told (Cc Nick Wood) the statistically correct way with --probability
setting would be doing a Bernoulli trial[1] or a "binomial experiment".
  This is how our userspace code (that gets all GRO/GSO packets) does
statistical sampling based on the number of segments (to get the correct
statistical probability):

The Rust code does this:
  let probability = 1.0 / sample_interval as f64;
  let adjusted_probability = nr_packets * probability * (1.0 - 
probability).powf(nr_packets - 1.0);

  [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial

We could (also) update the kernel code for --probability to do this, but
as you can see the Rust code uses floating point calculations.

It was easier to change the nth code (and easier for me to reason about)
than dealing with converting the the formula to use an integer
approximation (given we don't have floating point calc in kernel).

See above explanation about Bernoulli trial[1].
