Yes, that call succeeds. A following getsockopt() reveals a bufsize of
425984. Should we print a warning if the kernel accepts but restricts
the value? Not sure how well warnings work when emitted by libnftables,
though.

In mnl_nft_event_listener(), we check the return value of
mnl_set_rcvbuffer() and print an error message:

| nft_print(octx, "# Cannot set up netlink receive socket buffer size to %u bytes, falling back to %u bytes\n",
|                           NFTABLES_NLEVENT_BUFSIZ, bufsiz);

When called from mnl_batch_talk(), the return code is ignored.

Obviously this avoids the lockup. As correctly assumed by Florian,
firewalld startup fails instead. (The daemon keeps running, but an error
message is printed indicating that initial ruleset setup failed.)

Yes, it happens only for echo mode. With your fix in place, I also see
what firewalld is trying to do: The JSON input leading to the error is
huge (~72k characters). I suspect that GET_GENID just happens to be the
last straw. Or my debugging was faulty somehow and netlink_attachskb()
really got called via a different code-path.

The necessary lxd setup aside, it's pretty trivial: launch an instance
of images:centos/8/amd64, install firewalld therein, add two zone files
and start firewalld. It happens immediately, so two active zones already
make firewalld generate enough rules to exceed the buffer space.

This indeed "fixes" the problem. Or rather, exposes the actual problem
in echo-related code, namely the tendency to exhaust socket buffers.

So the problem we're facing is that while user space still waits for
sendmsg() to complete, receive buffer fills up. Is it possible to buffer
the data in kernel somewhere else so user space has a chance to call
recvmsg()?

Thanks, Phil
