Conntrackd does not rely on ID recycling. Conntrackd is in trouble
because of event loss. It seems the event re-delivery routine is
buggy, if the destroy event gets to userspace sooner or later, then
this entry would not get stuck in the cache forever. I can just remove
the check for the ID in userspace, so conntrackd would get rid of the
stale entry by when a new entry with the same tuple shows up (lazy
garbage collection).

Tuple could be artificially built from original source as source and
reply source as destination, those never change IIRC.

This hash-based ID calculation is a simple approach, but it looks weak
/ easy to break.
