I will (re-)do no such thing because you are refusing to make sense.

It's OK that the bridge code uses dev_queue_xmit() to send out an RST 
packet that has correct MACs, but that doesn't make another trip through 
netfilter.  And yet you object to my leveraging of the very same behaviour 
to solve the exact same issue in a non-bridge scenario.

Wow!  What the hell is going on here?!?!?

I'll tell you one thing that won't change, regardless of how many 
irrelevant complications you throw at it.  To wit, by using existing code, 
the patch I submitted solves the issue I was seeing.  Full stop.

Marc.
