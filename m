Suggest:
*accept*:: Terminate the evaluation of the chain.  Evaluation
continues in the next base chain, if any.

Thanks, that example is good to have.

Can this be compacted a bit?  I feel this is a tad too verbose.

*drop*: Packet is dropped immediately.  No futher evaluation of any kind.

I think thats enough, no?

You can remove 'eventually'.

Same.

No, not really.  There is no *overrule*.  We don't keep any 'verdict
state'.  There is no difference between 'drop' in the first rule of the
first ever base chain or a drop somewhere later in the pipeline, aside
from side effects from other matching expressions.

I would suggest:
For example, *reject* is like *drop*, but will attempt to send a error
reply packet back to the sender before doing so.

There is no overrule.  I would not mention NAT at all here.
*accept* documentation already says that later chains in the pipeline
can drop the packet (and so could the traffic scheduler, qdisc, NIC,
network ...)
