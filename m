SCTP_CHUNKMAP_IS_* macros are used from iptables/extensions/xt_sctp.h
(iptables userspace codebase). These macros are also used internally
from net/netfilter/xt_sctp.c. It's using a rather unorthodox trick to
share code between the kernel and userspace, otherwise iptables would
need to keep a copy of this code.

BTW, why do you need xt_sctp.h for the manpages? This header is rather
specific to the match on sctp from the xtables infrastructure, so it's
not so useful from a programmer perspective (manpages) I think.

I see, this is breaking self-compilation of the headers.

If there a need to remove xt_sctp.h from the ignore-list of the header
self-compilation infrastructure, it should be possible to fix
userspace to keep its own copy and probably add a #warn on the UAPI
header to let other possible consumers of this macro that this macro
will go away at some point.
