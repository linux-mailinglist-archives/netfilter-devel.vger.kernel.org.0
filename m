Via DHCP, my subnet's default route is a Linux system so that it can 
monitor all outbound traffic.  By doing so, for example, I have determined 
that my Android phone connects to Facebook despite the fact that I have no 
such app installed.  I want to know, and control, what other 
behind-the-scenes (under-handed) traffic devices on my subnet generate.

Well, I can tell you dev_queue_xmit() does in fact work in prerouting 
chains, as it must for the bridging case.  The only potential problem I've 
found so far is that the RST packet doesn't go through any netfilter 
hooks.
