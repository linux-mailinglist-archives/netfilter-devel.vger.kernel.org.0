I don't think so.  For TCPOPTSTRIP it makes sense because
you can't use multiple targets in one rule.

I'd rework this to not set BREAK if the option wasn't present
in the first place, so you could do

delete tcp option sack-perm delete tcp option timestamp ...

and so on.

Let me know if you disagree.

I could also rework it so that option comes from sreg instead
of imm, but i could not find a use-case where having the option number
coming from a map lookup would make sense.

Why 'reset'?  My initial version had 'remove' but 'delete'
already exists as a token so it was simpler.
