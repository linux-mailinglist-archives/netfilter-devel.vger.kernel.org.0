I don't understand this.  The swap can't be done before ->commit().
Else, how do you deal with a rollback (failing transaction)?

Not exposing any of the new elements to the data path until
the entire transaction has moved past the point-of-no-return
is large part of the patch series.

After commit, yes, we can do a walk of the old tree, purge
old elements, then walk the new tree, add new elements to the old
tree so they are identical again.

But that doesn't sound faster than duplicating everything
on next insert/removal.

How do I know what to re-insert and to remove from the old live tree
without a walk of the new tree?

How can the sync op fail?  Can you elaborate?
