It's a fairly simple and compact function, so compiler should inline it
without any problems. Mickaël was against optional inlines [1].

Looks like a rudimental check. `dom` is always NULL when `num_layers`< 1
(see get_*_domain functions).

I had a few ideas about refactoring commonalities, as currently landlock
has several repetitive patterns in the code. But solution requires a
good design and a separate patch. Probably it's worth opening an issue
on github. WDYT?

Yeah, this two should be merged and tests commits as well. I just wanted
to do this in one of the latest patch versions to simplify code review.
