If this is the kernel, why is pid not 0? And if pid is 0, then isn't 
exe=/boot/vmlinuz-X.Y.Z-blah?

Yes, any change to information flow must be auditable.

Exactly. But if someone does a search based on the fields, they need to be 
able to find this record. For example, suppose I want to know what actions 
have been performed by kernel_t, I can run a  search and find this event.

You can't search on the absense of information. There are some fields that 
have meaning. It's OK if they are unset. It happens for daemons, too. But we 
don't remove the fields because of it. It tells part of the story.
