You refer to element updates above, those used to be elided, yes. Now
they are shown. I think that is correct.

You mean, if 'flush' does not get expanded to one delete transaction
for each element. Yes, that would require to look at ->nelems as in
this patch.

My understanding is that audit is exposing the entries that have been
added/updated/deleted, which is already sparse: Note that nftables
audit works at 'table' granurality.

IIRC, one of the audit maintainers mentioned it should be possible to
add chain and set to the audit logs in the future, such change would
necessarily change the audit logs output.

Thanks.
