  Hi all,
  Sorry for the late reply. I think this access control would be useful.
  I would like to add LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_LISTEN_TCP access right in 
future patches.

   I agree. I'm not sure about restricting the data plane here. We have 
to restrict connection making, not data transfering when connection has 
been established.
