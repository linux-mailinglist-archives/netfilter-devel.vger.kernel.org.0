You can avoid parsing: it is possible to fill out the session data fields 
directly by calling ipset_data_set() and then issuing the required 
command.

You can "copy" the errcode table from the libipset source tree. Or it 
could be extended with a new ipset_errcode_raw() command which would just 
translate the returned errcode into the appropriate error string.
