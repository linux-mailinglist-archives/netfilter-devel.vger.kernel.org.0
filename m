I can add a commet before pushing this out.

All mptcp suboptions have this 4bit identifier at the same location,
so

'tcp option == mptcp' always allows to take those 4 bit to identify
the next subheader.

The only caveat is that some suboptions have different sizes depending
on the option length field, this will get more complicated once matching
on those is added (we will need to take moer dependencies into account).

Current solution I'm working on adds a phony integer type, similar
to the 'hex output' one.

Delinearization needs to do some extra steps to override the integer
again though.

I will share some draft patches soon.
