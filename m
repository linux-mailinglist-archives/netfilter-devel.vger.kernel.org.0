SYNPROXY is designed as a middlebox, both sender and responder are
considered to be on a different physical host, so its not possible to
signal that initial rtt measurment should be discarded.

If you are already using BPF, did you consider
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240115205514.68364-1-kuniyu@amazon.com/

instead of SYNPROXY?

(or just use normal tcp stacks syncookie mode, i don't see why you
 have to do upfront xdp cookies if its all on the same host ...).
