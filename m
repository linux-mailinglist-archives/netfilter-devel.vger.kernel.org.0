Amendment:

I: results: [OK] 264 [FAILED] 2 [TOTAL] 266

But this is because stateful expression in sets are not available in 5.10.

W: [FAILED]     ././testcases/sets/0059set_update_multistmt_0
W: [FAILED]     ././testcases/sets/0060set_multistmt_0

and tests/shell in 0.9.8 has not feature detection support.
