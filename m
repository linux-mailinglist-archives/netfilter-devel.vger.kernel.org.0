I agree that UAPI should not necessarily dictate the kernel

The imbalance between the user request and the required kernel memory is
interesting.  It would not be a security issue thanks to the
GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT, but it can be surprising for users that for some
requests they can receive -ENOMEM but not for quite-similar ones (e.g.
with only some bits different).  We should keep the principle of least
astonishment in mind, but also the fact that the kernel implementation
and the related required memory may change between two kernel versions
for the exact same user request (because of Landlock implementation
differences or other parts of the kernel).  In summary, we should be
careful to prevent users from being able to use a large amount of memory
with only one syscall.  This which would be an usability issue.

This is a safer approach that can indeed be documented, but it looks
unintuitive and an arbitrary limitation.  Here is another proposal:

Let's ignore my previous suggestion to use bitfields for families and
protocols.  To keep it simple, we can get back to the initial struct but
specifically handle the (i64)-1 value (which cannot be a family,
protocol, nor a type):
{
	.allowed_access = LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE,
	.family = AF_INET,
	.type = SOCK_STREAM,
	.protocol = -1,
},

This would read: deny socket creation except for AF_INET with
SOCK_STREAM (and any protocol).

Users might need to add several rules (e.g. one for AF_INET and another
for AF_INET6) but that's OK.  Unfortunately we cannot identify a TCP
socket with only protocol = IPPROTO_TCP because protocol definitions
are relative to network families.  Specifying the protocol without the
family should then return an error.

Before rule could be loaded, users define how much they want to match a
socket: at least the family, optionally the type, and if the type is
also set then the protocol can also be set.  These dependencies are
required to transform this triplet to a key number, see below.

A landlock_ruleset_attr.handled_socket_layers field would define how
much we want to match a socket:
- 1: family only
- 2: family and type
- 3: family, type, and protocol

According to this ruleset's property, users will be allowed to fill the
family, type, or protocol fields in landlock_socket_attr rules.  If a
socket layer is not handled, it should contain (i64)-1 for the kernel to
detect misuse of the API.

This enables us to get a key from this triplet:

family_bits = 6; // 45 values for now
type_bits = 3; // 7 values for now
protocol_bits = 5; // 28 values for now

// attr.* are the sanitized UAPI values, including -1 replaced with 0.
// In this example, landlock_ruleset_attr.handled_socket_layers is 3, so
// the key is composed of all the 3 properties.
landlock_key.data = attr.family << (type_bits + protocol_bits) |
                    attr.type << protocol_bits | attr.protocol;

For each layer of restriction in a domain, we know how precise they
define a socket (i.e. with how many "socket layers").  We can then look
for at most 3 entries in the red-black tree: one with only the family,
another with the family and the type, and potentially a third also
including the protocol.  Each key would have the same significant bits
but with the lower bits masked according to each
landlock_ruleset_attr.handled_socket_layers .  Composing the related
access masks according to the defined socket layers, we can create an
array of struct access_masks for the request and then check if such
request is allowed by the current domain.  As for the currently stored
data, we can also identify the domain layer that blocked the request
(required for audit).

With this design, each sandbox can define a socket as much as it wants.

The downside is that we lost the bitfields and we need several calls to
filter more complex sockets (e.g. 4 for UDP and TCP with IPv4 and IPv6),
which looks OK compared to the required calls for filesystem access
control.

red-black trees are a good generic data structure for the current main
use case (for dynamic rulesets and static domains), but we'll need to
use more appropriate data structures.  I think this should not be a
blocker for this patch series.  It will be required to match (port)
ranges though (even if the use case seems limited), and in general for
better performances.
