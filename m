   I would like to mention that in case of files a Landlock rule is tied 
to undreliying file's inode ( already existing at the moment of creating
    a landlock's rule), and it's impossible to tie a new landlock rule 
to a socket before it's creating. Thats why all network access rules 
work with "port objects", representing network connections.

I was thinking about sendind socket's FD to another process.
If one process creates a socket and binds it to some port N. Then it 
sends socket's FD to a landlocked process with rule restricting to bind
to port N. Is this situation theoretically possible???
