Oh, no listener on the backend -- now this tcpdump makes sense :-)

I wondered where synproxy would generate a reset.  It doesn't.  Doh.

Right, that part now makes sense too, we only sent the syn to the
backend, so we have not seen a reply yet.  The reset switches the
conntrack to CLOSED immediately, so that part now makes sense to me too.

Yes indeed.

Yes, perhaps also add a small comment to the tcpdump that the reset
is not coming from the synproxy machine but is originally received from
client.

Perhaps something like this:

Client then retries until timeout.


Thats just a suggestion so that its more obvious that we see only
one leg of the connection in the tcpdump.

This explanation makes sense, thanks a lot for elaborating on this.
