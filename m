Hi Florian,

Sorry, I overlook your reply.

Handling this from the core would be better, so people don't have to
remember to use the nfnetlink_unicast() that I'm proposing.

Looking at the tree, call_rcu is not enough to assume this: there are
several nfnetlink subsystems calling netlink_unicast() that translate
EAGAIN to ENOBUFS, from .call and .call_rcu. The way to identify this
would be to decorate callbacks to know what are specifically GET
commands.

So either do this or just extend my patch to use nfnetlink_send()
everywhere to remove all existing translations from EAGAIN to ENOBUFS.
