Functionally, it's doable. The downsides I see are:

1. This logic is already implemented by pipapo, so I would duplicate
   it.

   Other than code duplication itself, the worst part is the risk of
   (accidental) mismatch between the two implementations, and the fact
   that if we ever want to change this logic, we'll have to change it in
   two places (taking care of not breaking API, etc.)

2. It's going to be a bit more complicated than interval_overlap(),
   expect perhaps 50 LoCs, plus conditionals to select
   interval_overlap() or something_else_overlap()

3. [very, very debatable] I consider accepting already existing
   entries, without returning -EEXIST, a bug, no matter if NLM_F_EXCL
   was not passed: NLM_F_EXCL should simply mean what RFC 3549 says,
   that is, "Don't replace the config object if it already exists.". By
   leaving that "error clearing" in the API, we maintain this. On the
   other hand, even in the unlikely case we agree it's a bug, "fixing"
   it comes with UAPI breakage risks, too.

So, yes, I would like to avoid that, but if:

a. I can't return anything else than -EEXIST from nft_pipapo_insert()

b. I can't remove that "if (err == -EEXIST) err = 0;" part

then I don't see any other solution than implementing it in userspace.
I hope somebody had better ideas, but if not, I would go ahead and
implement it in userspace.
