Note that this behaviour was modified two years ago: earlier, this was
not the case (and by the way this is how we found out, as it broke a
user setup).

Other than this, I'm a bit confused. How could --packets-gt and
--bytes-gt be used, if counters don't increase as long as the rule
doesn't match?

I see, that would work as well.
