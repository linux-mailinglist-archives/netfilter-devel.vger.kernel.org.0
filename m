Which means we have to collect and maintain a list of all known keywords
which is at least error-prone.

You mean something that auto-generates the list of keywords to try?

Ah, I tried that path but always ended with shift/reduce conflicts. They
appear when replacing DYNAMIC with e.g. TABLE, CHAIN or RULE in your
patch. Of course we may declare that none of those is a sane name for a
table, but I wonder if we'll discover less obvious cases later.
