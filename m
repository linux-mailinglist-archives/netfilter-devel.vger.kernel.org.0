AFAICT, this is not related to granularity of caching logic. The crux is
that your fix of Florian's concurrency fix in commit f6ad231d698c7
("nft: keep original cache in case of ERESTART") ignores the fact that
cache may have to be rebuilt multiple times. I wasn't aware of it
either, but knowing that each COMMIT line causes a COMMIT internally
makes it obvious. Your patch adds code to increment cache_index but none
to reset it to zero.

I didn't review those patches yet, but from a quick glance it doesn't
seem to touch the problematic code around __nft_flush_cache(). Let's
make a deal: You accept my fix for the existing cache logic and I'll in
return fix your series if necessary and at least find out what needs to
be done so it doesn't cause a performance regression.

I don't veto against or sabotage your approach of separating caching
from parsing, but completing your series regarding performance as an
alternative assuming it fixes the existing bug at all is not feasible.
Therefore please let's go with a fix first and commit to cache logic
rewrite as illustrated in your patches.

Cheers, Phil
