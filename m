I'll append this to the description before applying, no problem,
thanks for asking.

Yes, if 'automerge' is set on, then nft should start doing some more
intelligent stuff. Basically the idea is: check if this interval
overlaps with an existing one, if so transaction looks like this:

        [ delete 25-35 | add 20-35 ]

With the existing transaction infrastructure in place, I think it
should not be too hard. There's already a routine to check for
overlaps. If this is a data mapping, this needs to be careful to not
merge intervals that have different data on the right hand side.

There's another problem, I think incremental userspace cache is still
incomplete. I can probably scratch time and look into this, this might
not happen before 2020 though.

Thanks.
