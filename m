Hi,=0A=
=0A=
We recently upgraded the version of conntrack-tools and libnetfilter-conntr=
ack that we are using and have found a bug when using conntrack to update I=
CMP flows. I've tracked down where the bug is occurring, but am looking for=
 some guidance on the preferred way to fix it.=0A=
=0A=
E.g. Doing the following when there are icmp flows present has no effect on=
 ICMP flows:=0A=
conntrack -f ipv4 -U --mark=3D1=0A=
=0A=
In conntrack-tools in conntrack.c in update_cb, the ORIG data and META data=
 are copied, but not the REPL data. This has been this way for quite some t=
ime.=0A=
nfct_copy(tmp, ct, NFCT_CP_ORIG);=0A=
nfct_copy(tmp, obj, NFCT_CP_META);=0A=
=0A=
However, in libnetfilter-conntrack the way that the message is built has be=
en changed, and in nfct_nlmsg_build, the check about whether to build the R=
EPL tuple has been extended to include=0A=
test_bit(ATTR_ICMP_TYPE, ct->head.set) ||=0A=
test_bit(ATTR_ICMP_CODE, ct->head.set) ||=0A=
test_bit(ATTR_ICMP_ID, ct->head.set)=0A=
=0A=
In the old building functions, these bits weren't present, so it wouldn't t=
ry to build the REPL tuple, so everything worked. However, now it tries to =
build the REPL tuple, and because none of the REPL data is present, buildin=
g the tuple fails and it errors out without sending the request to the kern=
el.=0A=
=0A=
My question is whether it is better to remove the checks in libnetfilter-co=
nntrack or add the copy of the REPL data in conntrack tools.=0A=
=0A=
Upgraded:=0A=
libnetfilter-conntrack from 1.0.6 to 1.0.8=0A=
conntrack-tools from 1.4.4 to 1.4.6=0A=
=0A=
Kind regards,=0A=
Luuk=
