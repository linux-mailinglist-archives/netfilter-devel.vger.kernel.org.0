Hi,

When there are 1 or more, proxy needs to load balance incoming connections between endpoints.I thought to create vmap per service with 1 rule per service . When an endpoint gets updated (add/deleted) which could happen anytime then the only vmap get corresponding update and my hope was that automagically load balancing will be adjusted to use updated endpoints list.

If numgen work only with static anonymous vmap and fixed modulus , the only way to address this dynamic nature of endpoints is to recreate service rule everytime when number of endpoints changes (recalculate modulus and entries in vmap). I suspect it is way less efficient.

Well, if you have a modulus of, say, 5 and your vmap contains only
entries 0 to 3 your setup is broken anyway. So I guess you will need to
adjust modulus along with entries in vmap at all times.

What is the iptables-equivalent you want to replace? Maybe that serves
as inspiration for how to solve it in nftables.

Well, you could replace the rule in a single transaction, that would
eliminate the timespan the rule doesn't exist. AFAICT, this is RCU-based
so packets will either hit the old or the new rule then.

Cheers, Phil
