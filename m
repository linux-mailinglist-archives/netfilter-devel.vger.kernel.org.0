There is more to distcheck than just the 'make check' call, so it's
definitely worth doing it. The best option might be to run 'make
distcheck' before the release for a complete test run and only 'make
dist' during the release process. Though this requires to run 'make
distcheck' as root, not sure if that is a good idea.

Does not seem feasible, especially for a redundant test run you're not
interested in. It also implies that you're creating the distribution on
a system which is able to pass (or skip) all tests, which may not be the
case.

Also an option, yes. Or a custom 'make testrun' or so.

A cool feature of automake is to run tests in parallel. I have a local
branch which implements that for iptables. Makefile.am has to list every
test case though, which adds overhead (and room for errors) when writing
new tests.

Yes, I don't see a way to instruct 'make distcheck' to perform multiple
builds with different configure options.

tests/build is funny: It runs 'make distcheck' itself, so adding
tests/build/run-tests.sh to TESTS variable in Makefile.am should lead to
an infinite distcheck loop. :D

This happens due to the separate source and build directories, the
compiled 'nft' tool (actually: wrapper) is not in the same tree as the
test runner.
