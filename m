...by the way, I observed it as well, and I was wondering: how bad is
too bad? My guess was that as long as we insert a few thousand elements
(with more, I expect hash or pipapo to be used) in a few seconds, it
should be good enough.

I see a problem with this, that perhaps you already solved, but I don't
understand how.

The original issue here was that we have inactive elements in the tree
affecting the way we descend it to look for overlaps. Those inactive
elements are not necessarily overlapping with anything.

If they overlap, the issue is solved with your patch. But if they
don't...?

Sure, we'll grant insertion of overlapping elements in case the overlap
is with an inactive one, but this solves the particular case of
matching elements, not overlapping intervals.

At a first reading, I thought you found some magic way to push out all
inactive elements to some parallel, linked structure, which we can
ignore as we look for overlapping _intervals_. But that doesn't seem to
be the case, right?
