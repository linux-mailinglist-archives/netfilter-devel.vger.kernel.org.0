Or a big fat warning, but I fear anything that allows

will simply be ignored until the problems become obvious.

Pablo, I think you're mixing up two things here:

This "support dump and load of compat expression" feature is to sanitize
the current situation with up to date iptables and nftables.

The forward compat (you were right about the direction) issue is mostly
about iptables-nft vs. itself in an older version.

Cheers, Phil
