If the .nft file contains lots of (linear syntax):

add rule x y ... { ... }
...
add rule x y ... { ... }

then, this patch is a real gain. In this case, nft currently places
the new anonymous set right before the rule, so your patch makes it
perform nicely.

I hesitate with the nested syntax, ie.

table x {
       chain y {
                ... { ... }
                ...
                ... { ... }
       }
}

In this case, nft adds all the anonymous sets at the beginning of the
netlink message, then rules don't find it right at the end.

Probably it's better to convert this code to use a rhashtable for fast
lookups on the transaction so we don't mind about what userspace does
in the future.

Thanks.
