The latter: I was fixing for '-i +' which is legal in iptables but
'iifname "*"' in nftables is not and I also had to find a way to
translate it correctly if inverted.

In theory neither '-i +' nor '! -i +' make sense, from my perspective we
could reject both. Or only the latter since it seems even more bogus
than the former.

I was asking about legacy because I really think we should not change
iptables-nft in a way we wouldn't with legacy. At least rejecting
rulesets which worked fine with legacy is a no go.

Cheers, Phil
