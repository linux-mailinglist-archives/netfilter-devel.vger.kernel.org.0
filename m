Thanks for the prompt reply!

(I just noticed the netfilter@ list, sorry for having asked the question
here instead)

Ok.

Ok, firewalld rules are in a different table but they set priorities to
mangle + 10 so I tested something similar and it does work:

table inet test {
    chain premangle {
        type filter hook prerouting priority mangle + 10; policy accept;
        meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing log prefix "rpfilter_DROP: " drop
    }
}

(I also confirmed moving the iptables, unsurprisingly it works and does
require the --validmark switch suggested)



I also found that adding --loose to the ip6tables rule also works, I've
had a look at the man page[1] and can't say I understand how to make an
equivalent 'loose' rule as nft, but I'll keep trying a while longer.
(I'm asking because the ipv4 default seems to be loose on my setup, so
I'm surprised ipv6 would be different; not decided on what to actually
use)

I'll get back to the firewalld developer to discuss what would be
the preferred solution, thanks again for the help.
