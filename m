I think the only contraint is that it must not overlap with a
legitimate ifindex.

But 0 cannot occur, so 'meta iif 0' will only match in case no input
interface existed -- I think thats fine and might even be desired.

Thats my point, we can't use a value that can occur normally.

O know.

I would propose to go with '0' dreg for ifindex, "" for name and leave
rest as-is.
