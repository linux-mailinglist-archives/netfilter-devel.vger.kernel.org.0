Indeed. It was my cat that typed _and_set in there. ;-] (joking) sorry.

Unless it goes idle, yes.

It may not be empty even for sw datapath. If you have packets coming
from the wire towards a veth/virtio, for example. It will likely
having a matching act_ct with the same zone number on both directions.
And/or if a zone is shared, as the the flow table then is also shared.
