I think we should isolate more, if we can. In v2, there is a test an
fallback to without "-P". How about that?

In v2, NFT_TEST_ROOTLESS is dropped and a notice added.

I don't. Dropped in v2.

Addressed in v2 (with some variations).

No. run-tests.sh is currently *the* runner script for running tests.
It must always be useful to call directly.

But it *might* be useful to call it from a wrapper script (like a make
target).

Already before, the script supports various command line options, but
those options were also settable via an environment variable. E.g.
"VERBOSE=3Dy" vs. "-v".

I followed that style in v2. How about that?

The only unsane default was NFT_TEST_ROOTLESS to opt-in to make
something work. It now works by default.
