Right, read lock is not enough for sync GC, and it would be also
required by this approach.

And it will in case of the update to remove the expired element, right?

After your last fix, not really, other than we have to be care not to
zap elements that are in any of the pending transaction in this batch.

Not a problem now, but this path that we follow blocks a requested
feature.

I currently do not know how to support for set element timeout update
with this on-demand GC on the rbtree. This feature will require a new
update state in the transaction to update the timer for an element. We
will have to be careful because on-demand GC might zap an expired
element that got just refreshed in this transaction (unless we
reintroduce some sort of 'busy' bit for updates again which is
something I prefer we do not). With 2ee52ae94baa ("netfilter:
nft_set_rbtree: skip sync GC for new elements in this transaction")
I could fix by looking at the generation mask to infer that this
element is 'busy' by some pending transaction, but I do not see a way
with an element update command in place.

Maybe take your patch and then follow up to nf-next with this approach
based once set element timer update is introduced? Otherwise, rbtree
will block the introduction of this new feature for other sets too.
