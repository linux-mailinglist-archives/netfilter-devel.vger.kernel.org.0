I also tried using "l3s" mode that should to go through netfilter, but in that case, packets for virtual IPs are rejected with a TCP reset. Virtual IPs in namespace seem not visible to this mode.

In this example physical load balancer interface is enp4s0, virtual IP is 192.168.42.1 (to be exported by a routing protocol, or route manually added to a client in same subnet as load balancer for testing), load balancer IP is 192.168.10.10, and real server IP is 192.168.20.20

	Make sure /proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/conntrack is set to 1
to allow IPVS to keep the netfilter conntracks for its
packets. This is supported with the CONFIG_IP_VS_NFCT=y
kernel option.
