It is actually not that uniform. While we have:

--enable-debug
--enable-man-doc
--enable-python

we also have:

--with-mini-gmp
--with-cli
--with-xtables
--with-json

and all of them just enable/disable something, unlike --with-python-bin.

For consistency, we should turn all of the above --with flags into
--enable ones, but there's of course the compatibility problem.

What do you think, is it feasible to change all the above and introduce
--with aliases for them?

Cheers, Phil
