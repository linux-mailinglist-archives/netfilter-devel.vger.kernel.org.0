Why is this a problem? meter-set are basically a set with a
counter/quota/etc... that is created from the packet path. It should
be possible to make lookups on the content of this set.

I think we can just check instead from nft_lookup if there is an
extension in this then, instead of checking for the NFT_SET_EVAL flag
to fix this. Hence, you can make lookups on dynamic sets, but not on
dynamic sets with extensions.
