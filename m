The kernel proclaims a stable ABI.
About the C API, I am not certain, but I presume there are no restriction --
old netfilter headers have been removed in the past (and userspace was to make
a copy if it wanted to build the byte streams required by the ABI
by way of a few "struct"s rather than pushing individual uint32_t fields into a
buffer).
A zero-size member does not impact the ABI at least.
