How could this possibly happen?

nf_ct_expires() is called from:

- ctnetlink_dump_timeout(), this is netlink dump path, since:

    netfilter: conntrack: remove the percpu dying list

it is not possible to do any listing of unconfirmed, and that is fine.

As I said, nfnetlink_queue operates with an unconfirmed conntrack with
owns exclusively, which is not in the hashes.

- nf_ct_expires() calls from xt and nft matches are irrelevant:

net/netfilter/nft_ct.c:         *dest = jiffies_to_msecs(nf_ct_expires(ct));
net/netfilter/xt_conntrack.c:           unsigned long expires = nf_ct_expires(ct) / HZ;

- there is the garbage collector, but that only works with conntrack
  entries in the hashes:

net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.c:                      expires = clamp(nf_ct_expires(tmp), GC_SCAN_INTERVAL_MIN, GC_SCAN_INTERVAL_CLAMP);

- there is also /proc interface, but that only works with conntrack
  entries in the hashes:

net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_standalone.c:                seq_printf(s, "%ld ", nf_ct_expires(ct)  / HZ);

I can see there are two possible states for ct->timeout, thanks for
explaining this again.

it does not even make sense to use WRITE_ONCE from
__nf_conntrack_confirm(), see:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.c#L1260

because the unconfirmed conntrack object is owned exclusively by the packet.

Maybe you have an old kernel?
