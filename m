Yes, I'm opposed to duplicating fields across records in a single
event.  If there are cases where we have a standalone record, such as
with "unregister", then there is an argument to be made about
duplicating some fields that are important in the standalone
unregister case.  However, this is *only* for those fields which make
sense in the standalone kernel unregister event; if the field isn't
useful in this unregister corner case *and* it is duplicated in
another record type which normally accompanies this record in an event
there is no reason it needs to be in this record.

To be clear, we are not changing any existing record formats; they are
part of the kernel/userspace ABI and changing them would break the
ABI.

In a perfect world both the audit kernel and userspace would have been
designed, implemented, and documented better.  Unfortunately it wasn't
and we have to live with what we have.
