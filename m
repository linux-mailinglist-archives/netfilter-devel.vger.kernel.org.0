Looking into this, I wonder if it might cause confusion with regards to
stateful objects:

My original patch implements:

- reset rule [<fam>] <table> <chain> handle <num>
- reset rules [<fam>]
- reset rules table [<fam>] <table>
- reset rules chain [<fam>] <table> <chain>

This is relatively consistent with list command, which (e.g.) has:

- list set [<fam>] <table> <set>
- list sets [<fam>]
- list sets table [<fam>] <table>

IIRC, your request at NFWS was to introduce something like:

- reset table (for 'reset rules table')
- reset chain (for 'reset rules chain')

But the first one may seem like resetting *all* state of a table,
including named quotas, counters, etc. while in fact it only resets
state in rules.

Cheers, Phil
