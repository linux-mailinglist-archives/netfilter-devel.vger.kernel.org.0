Of course, what else! :-) And I haven't said anything different.

It's maybe complicated: I've a restrictive firewall where
the default is to block all ports for traffic from INPUT,
except those explicitly allowed.

Then, at the end of the firewall rules I can _auto-add_ all
the unhandled IPs to such a set for blocking. The blocking
happens at top by testing whether the IP is in that set.

But another feature of this solution is that not only
the firewall can (auto-) add IPs to the set for blocking,
but also the external handlers after ACCEPT can do it,
ie. say a mailserver. It too has to be able to add an IP
to the same set for  blocking. The blockign itself happens
centrally in the firewall script at the next attempt of the attacker.

Lately I've extended this to make it a 2-stage: if blocked IP
continues sending more than x packets while in timeout of y minutes,
then add this attacker to the second set that has a much higher timeout of z 
minutes.
One additional practical benefit of this approach is that
now one sees the hardcore attackers grouped (they are those in set2).

The correct managing of these two sets requires the said
atomicity by testing of BOTH sets before adding the IP to the first set...

If you have got a better solution for this use-case,
so let me/us know please. As said I'm new even to ipset
but which I find very effective & useful in practice.
As said I'm still continuing using iptables with ipset,
just evaluating whether it would make sense to switch to nftables/nft,
though the learning-curve seems not that small, IMO.
