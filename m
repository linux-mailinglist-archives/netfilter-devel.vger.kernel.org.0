It is, thanks Jakub!

With my updated test case, it does pass, but see for yourself:
# PASS: sctp and nfqueue in forward chain (duration: 118s)
# PASS: sctp and nfqueue in output chain with GSO (duration: 56s)

(the old timeout was 60s, so this would FAIL without the updated test).

plain net-next/main:
# PASS: sctp and nfqueue in forward chain (duration: 42s)
# PASS: sctp and nfqueue in output chain with GSO (duration: 21s)

I haven't debugged yet but i'd guess that some packets get corrupted
when nfqueue segments gso skbs, thus forcing retransmits.

The nfqueue test also forces software segmentation, even for lo, so that
the userspace listener gets non-aggregated packets (its possible to
disable this so 'large packets' get queued to userspace, this is also
tested for tcp by this selftest).

both show sctp failing:

# PASS: tcp via loopback and re-queueing

---> tcp loopback passes

so its sctp+nfqueue thats failing.
And it does seem to be related to the pending patch pointed out by
Jakub.

I'll resend the update tomorrow, keeping the OLD timeout of 60s, I think
keeping track of the 'transmit time' in the test log archives could be
useful in the future.

5s isn't so short, lo is supposed to be fast (the userspace prog
asks for GSO packets, so no s/w segmentation should happen but even
with GSO segmentation I would not expect it to fail).

I would prefer to keep the 5s for tcp; I don't recall this was a problem
in the past.
