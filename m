I think the main problem is the difference between nft and iptables when 
printing the base chains and their policy, as you wrote:

It looks as nft would loose the DROP policy of FORWARD! That looks like 
definitely wrong. It was explicitly set, so it should be printed/saved. 

Also, if nft in >legacy mode< would print the base chains with their 
policy (regardless of the value), couldn't then restore mode handle those 
properly?

Me too... :-)
