I see, so you were considering the worst case. You're assuming each
element takes exactly one pipapo rule, so it's 2^16 elements, correct?

You refer to a property that says that you can split a range into a
2*n netmasks IIRC. Do you know what is the worst case when splitting
ranges?

There is no ipset set like this, but I agree usecase might happen.

Yes, this is large. Compared to a hashtable with 2^16 entries, then
it's 2^17 hashtable buckets and using struct hlist_head, this is 2
MBytes. Then, each hlist_node is 16 bytes, so 2^16 * 16 ~= 1 MByte.
That is 3 MBytes if my maths are fine.

Just telling this to find what could be considered as reasonable
amount of memory to be consumed. ~10 MBytes is slightly more than, but
I agree you selected a reasonable worst through this "complex tuple".

Yes, keeping this maintainable is a good idea.

The per-cpu scratch index is only required if we cannot fit in the
"result bitmap" into the stack, right?

Probably up to 256 bytes result bitmap in the stack is reasonable?
That makes 8192 pipapo rules. There will be no need to disable bh and
make use of the percpu scratchpad area in that case.

If adjusting the code to deal with variable length "pipapo word" size
is not too convoluted, then you could just deal with the variable word
size from the insert / delete / get (slow) path and register one
lookup function for the version that is optimized for this pipapo word
size.

Probably adding helper function to deal with pipapo words would help
to prepare for such update in the future. There is the ->estimate
function that allows to calculate for the best word size depending on
all the information this gets from the set definition.

Just to keep this in the radar for future work.

Thanks.
