No, sorry. The show-stopper is, no allowance for the "extra" arg, when you might
want to mangle a packet tobe larger than it was.

For "extra" support, you need something with the sophistication of pktb_malloc2.
If extra == 0, pktb_malloc2 optimises by leaving the packet data where it was.
Actually pktb_malloc2 doesn't need to make this decision. That can be deferred
to pktb_mangle, which could do the copy if it has been told to expand a packet
and the copy has not already been done (new "copy done" flag in the opaque
struct pkt_buff).

My nfq-based accidentally-written ad blocker would benefit from that deferment -
I allow extra bytes in case I have to lengthen a domain name, but most of the
time I'm shortening them.

In https://www.spinics.net/lists/netfilter-devel/msg65830.html, you suggested a
pair of functions: pktb_alloc2 & pktb_head_size.

I really prefer that to your new suggestions.

More later,

Cheers ... Duncan.
