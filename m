I plan to make iptables-nft prefer ACTUAL when fetching rules. Comparing
against EXPRESSIONS is as easy as comparing two rules, but useful rather
as debug-option for sanity checks. The "evil admin" case you mention is
relevant with old user space, which obviously can't do any verification.

While indeed two lookup expressions will refer to the same anonymous
set, only one of those expressions will ever be in use. There's no way
the kernel would switch between rule variants (or use both at the same
time).

That's not true, at least ebtables' among match is implemented using
sets. :)
