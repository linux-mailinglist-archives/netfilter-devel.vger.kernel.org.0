Very timely of you to ask.

Just this morning I was going to get back into libnetfilter_queue documentation,
starting with the other 2 verdict helpers.

But I ran into a conundrum with nfq_nlmsg_verdict_put_mark (the one I didn't
use). It's a 1-liner (in src/nlmsg.c):

> 56  mnl_attr_put_u32(nlh, NFQA_MARK, htonl(mark));

But examples/nf-queue.c has an example to set the connmark which doesn't use
nfq_nlmsg_verdict_put_mark()

Instead it has this line:

> 52  mnl_attr_put_u32(nlh, CTA_MARK, htonl(42));

The trouble is, NFQA_MARK *is different from* CTA_MARK. NFQA_MARK is 3, while
CTA_MARK is 8.

At this point, I felt I did not understand the software well enough to be able
to document it further. If you could shed some light on this apparent
disrcepancy, it might restore my self-confidence sufficiently that I can
continue documenting.

Cheers ... Duncan.
