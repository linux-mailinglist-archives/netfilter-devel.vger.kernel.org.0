list iteration? What?  But netdev:ingress can't be used because
its too slow?!

I'm going to stop responding, sorry.

Netfilter already has byzantine technical debt, I don't want
to maintain any more 8-(

Ugh.  This is already problematic.  Pipeline/processing ordering matters.

Thanks for reminding me.  This is also bad.
Flowtable offload is tied to conntrack, yes.

But rule offload SHOULD NOT be tied to connection tracking.
What you are proposing is the ability to attach rules to a conntrack
entry.

Wnich devices?  Error handling?

Only == not called for slowpath.

I don't understand you, you reject netdev:ingress/egress
but want a new conntrack extension that iterates flow_offload entries in
software?

No, XDP *DOES NOT* have them.  nftables sets and ebpf sets are
completely different entities.  'nft add element inet filter bla { 1.2.3,4 }

will not magically alter some ebpf set.

They also have different scoping rules.

I think you should use netdev:ingress/egress hook points.

Or use an xdp program and don't use netfilter at all.

If you want to use nftables sets with ebpf, then you might investigate
adding kfuncs for ebpf so nftables sets can be used from bpf programs,
that might actually be useful for some people, but I'm not sure how to
make this work at this time due to nature of set/map scoping in
nftables.  We have to be mindful to not crash kernel when table/set/map
is going away on netfilter side.
