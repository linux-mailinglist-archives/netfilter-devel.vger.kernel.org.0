Yes, I did. As expected, some tests fail - e.g. in the old kernel
IDLETIMER rev 1 is not available, so xt_IDLETIMER.t fails partially:

| % sudo ip netns exec test ./iptables-test.py extensions/libxt_IDLETIMER.t
| extensions/libxt_IDLETIMER.t: ERROR: line 5 (cannot load: iptables -A INPUT -j IDLETIMER --timeout 42 --label foo --alarm)
| 1 test files, 4 unit tests, 3 passed
| 
| % sudo ip netns exec test ./iptables-test.py -n extensions/libxt_IDLETIMER.t
| extensions/libxt_IDLETIMER.t: ERROR: line 5 (cannot load: iptables -A
| INPUT -j IDLETIMER --timeout 42 --label foo --alarm)
| 1 test files, 4 unit tests, 3 passed

Obviously, IDLETIMER rev 1 will stay lingering in pending target list
and retried for each parsed rule:

| % sudo ./install/sbin/iptables-nft-save
| # Generated by iptables-nft-save v1.8.5 on Wed Sep 23 16:37:09 2020

But this is per design, assuming that Serhey fixed a real issue in
3b2530ce7a0d6 ("xtables: Do not register matches/targets with
incompatible revision").

Do you have something else in mind I should watch out for?

Thanks, Phil
