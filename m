Yes, at the very beginning, not with the final implementation. It was
somewhat faster (on x86_64, I don't remember how much) for small
numbers of rules, then I thought we would use too much memory, because:

...the (reasonable?) worst case I wanted to cover was two IPv6
addresses, one port, one MAC address (in ipset terms
"net,net,port,mac"), with 2 ^ 16 unique, non-overlapping entries each
(or ranges expanding to that amount of rules), because that's what
(single, non-concatenated) ipset "bitmap" types can do.

Also ignoring the mapping table (it's "small"), with 4-bit buckets:

- for the IPv6 addresses, we have 16 buckets, each 2 ^ 16
  bits wide, and 32 groups (128 bits / 4 bits), that is, 8MiB in
  total

- for the MAC address, 16 buckets, each 2 ^ 16 bits wide, and 12
  groups, 1.5MiB

- for the port, 16 buckets, each 2 ^ 12 bits wide, 2 groups, 0.25MiB

that is, 9.75MiB.

With 8-bit buckets: we can just multiply everything by 8 (that is,
2 ^ 8 / 2 ^ 4 / 2, because we have 2 ^ (8 - 4) times the buckets, with
half the groups), 78MiB.

And that started feeling like "a lot". However, I'm probably overdoing
with the worst case -- this was just to explain what brought me to the
4-bit choice, now I start doubting about it.

Another topic is the additional amount of cachelines we would use. I
don't expect that effect to be visible, but I might be wrong.

So yes, I think it's definitely worth a try, thanks for the hint! I'll
try to look into this soon and test it on a few archs (something with
small cachelines, say MIPS r2k, would be worth checking, too).

We could even consider to dynamically adjust group size depending on
the set size, I don't know yet if that gets too convoluted.

Right! Good catch, thanks.

I swapped the values also in the "insertion" example above. For some
reason, this was correct in the equivalent example of the stand-alone
implementation:

Yes, that's correct. Let me know if you want me to send a patch or if
you'd rather fix it.

You're right, I wanted to make sure we avoid branching for the "common"
case (this early return happens just once), but this is probably an
abuse. I'll look into a more acceptable way to achieve this.
