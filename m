Let's give a try to this patch:

Something else to improve netlink socket receiver usage: Userspace
might also set on NLM_F_ECHO for rules only, so the kernel only
consumes the netlink receive socket buffer for these reports. Although
not sure how to expose this yet through the library in a nice way...

Probably it should be possible to extend netlink to filter out
attributes that do not need to be reported back to userspace via
NLM_F_ECHO...

The main gain is to amortize skbuff cost, ie. increasing the batching
factor, but going over NLMSG_GOODSIZE is tricky. We have to update
userspace (provide larger buffer) and revisit if this is possible
without breaking backward compatibility.

BTW, if NLM_F_ECHO results in ENOSPC, the ruleset has been applied,
it's just that the socket buffer got full, a fallback to NLM_F_DUMP is
probably an option in that case? But I understand the goal is to not
hit ENOSPC.

Let me know if my patch helps mitigate the problem, thanks.
