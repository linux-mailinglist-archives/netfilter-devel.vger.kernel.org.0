Yes, it would work, unless the user actually wants to check with the
same counter how many bytes are sent "in excess".

Now, I see the conceptual problem about matching: if the rule isn't
matching, and counters count matched packets, counters shouldn't
increase. But still, I think there are a number of facts to
be considered:

- the man page says (and has said for a number of years):

	If the packet is matched an element in the set, match only if
	the byte counter of the element is greater than the given value
	as well.

  which actually makes the problem undecidable: matching depends on
  matching itself. Trying some "common sense" interpretation, I would
  read this as:

	If the packet matches an *element* in the set, this *rule* will
	match only if the byte counter of the element is greater than
	the given value.

  that is, by separating the meaning of "element matching" from "rule
  matching", this starts making sense.

- I spent the past two hours trying to think of an actual case that was
  affected by 4750005a85f7, *other than the "main" bug it fixes*, that
  is, "! --update-counters" was ignored altogether, and I couldn't.

  Even if we had a --bytes-lt option, it would be counter-intuitive,
  because the counter would be updated until bytes are less than the
  threshold, and then the rule would stop matching, meaning that the
  user most probably thinks:

	"Drop matching packets as long as less than 800 bytes are sent"

  and what happens is:

	"Count and drop matching packets until 800 bytes are sent, then
	stop dropping and counting them"

  The only "functional" case I can think of is something like
  --bytes-lt 800 -j ACCEPT. User probably thinks:

	"Don't let more than 800 bytes go through"

  and what happens is:

	"Let up to 800 bytes, or 799 bytes plus one packet, go through,
	counting the bytes in packets that were let through"

  which isn't much different from the expectation.

...yes, I can't think of any other use for those either.

...this should probably be "in any case", also if it's true.

I think that would fix the issue as well, I'm just struggling to find a
sensible use case for the "no --update-counters" case -- especially one
where there would be a substantial issue with the change I proposed.
