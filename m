Updated:

 src/libnetfilter_queue.c: - ip_queue withdrawn in kernel 3.5
                           - Update some URLs
                           - libmnl is a dependency
                           - Multiword section headers need a tag
                           - Re-work cinematic to refer to nft
                           - Some native English speaker updates
                             (e.g. enqueue *is* a word)
                           - Prefer nf-queue.c over deprecated doxygen doco
