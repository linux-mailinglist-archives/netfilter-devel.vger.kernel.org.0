Thanks.

Which one?  As far as I can see TCP stack would end up adding a
duplicate quadruple to the hash if we only drop the reference and
keep the listen sk around.

And if we assign the tw socket to the skb TCP stack might not be able
to find the correct listener if the service is on a different port
than what is in the TCP header.

Did I miss anything?
