This can be done through _INC / _DEC instead, however...

I think some simplified version of bignum add/subtract is needed,
something like:

        for (i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                res[i] = a[i] + b[i] + carry;
                carry = res[i] < a[i] + b[i];
        }

where 'len' is in bytes. Values in a[] and b[] are u8 and data is
represented in big endian.
