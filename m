There is currently no syntax, so this needs to be defined.

Maybe something like:

     { "jump": { "chain" : [ rules here ] }

but I would need to sketch some code to explore how complicate this is
to reuse existing JSON code.

OK, so it is chain statement that is missing the json callback.

Ah, I see, so it is not easy to compare. Thanks for explaining.
