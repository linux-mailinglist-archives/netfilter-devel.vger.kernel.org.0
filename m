Hmm, to what should this be transformed?
ct state established,new ?

We can do it for this one, established and new can never be set at the
same time (or any other state for that matter).

I think if you do a 'nft add rule' then you expect to add a rule and
not to modify an existing one.

There is also the performance aspect, for 'nft add' you can just
build the rule object and pass that to kernel, but for optimizing
you need to fetch what is there and perform analysis on it.

I should have be more specific, with "nft -f" i meant a full rule
file, not a partial one (esp. one that has a 'flush ruleset'), or
something that at least contains a complete subset, e.g. a new
chain with n rules.

We could add a command line switch for this and allow optimizing in
any case, or add a new 'nft compact' or 'nft optimize' command that
would fetch the ruleset and print the 'optimized' version what nft
thinks can be coalesced/omitted etc.

What do you think?

Sure, lets do that.
