I can reproduce it on current 1.0.6.y branch (HEAD at 3bd7fec6245f):

| # nft -f - <<EOF
| p ipfoo {
| 	map y {
| 		type ipv4_addr : ipv4_addr . inet_service
| 		elements = { 192.168.7.2 : 10.1.1.1 . 4242 }
| 	}
| 
| 	chain c {
| 	}
| }
| # valgrind --leak-check=full nft add rule ip ipfoo c dnat to ip daddr map @y

It reports:

Oh, indeed, this is non-sense. I doubt the Fixes: tag is appropriate even.

Yes, this is the script taking its toll. ;)

That alone is not enough: The script works based on tags, i.e. for each tag it
checks if origin/master has a commit with a Fixes: tag referencing a commit
contained in that tag or in the list of potential backports identified via the
same method.

One would have to change it to work based on *.y branches and the actual
commits in there. I'll give it a quick try, shouldn't be too hard
indeed.
