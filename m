Can the 'level' field be moved to this nft_expr_ctx structure? This
field is only used from the preparation phase (not in the commit
phase).

Probably we need to rename nft_ctx to nft_trans_ctx, so it contains
the fields that are needed from the commit phase. Then, re-add a
nft_ctx again which contains nft_trans_ctx at the beginning, then the
register bitmap and the level field. Thus, any future fields only
required by preparation phase only will go in nft_ctx, and fields that
are specifically are set up from preparation phase and consumed from
commit step go in nft_trans_ctx.

It is a bit of churn, but it is probably good to tidy up this for
future extensions?

Let me know, thanks.
