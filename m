Your question was about MSS sent to server.

Flow is this:
Client          Synproxy         Server
-> Syn, mss X
    <-Synack,mss M
-> ACK
                     -> Syn, mss Y

M is what you need to configure via --mss switch.

Because Synproxy keeps no state, it can only send
to real server the MSS that was encoded in syncookie (in synack)
packet.  Therefore, X == Y only if the Value from client matches
exactly one for the four values of the mss table, in all other
cases Y is the next lowest available one.  In your case thats 536.

We only have 2 bits out of the 32Bit Sequence number for MSS. Increasing
mss state table reduces security margin of the cookie.
