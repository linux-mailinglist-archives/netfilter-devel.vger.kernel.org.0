Right, there is an amalgamation of different issues, lets not get swamped
trying to solve everything at once :-)

I've collected a few patches and pushed them out to :testing.
Stresstest is still running but so far it looks good to me.

The updated audit selftest passes, as does Xins sctp test case.

I expect to do the PR in the next few hours or so.

I will followup on nf-next once upstream has pulled the PR
into net and did a net -> net-next merge, which might take a
while. Followup as in "send rebased patches that get rid of
the async gc in nft_set_rbtree".

Let me know if there is anything else I can help
with.

Phil, I know all of this sucks from your point of view,
this is also my fault, I did not pay too close attention
to the reset patches, and, to be clear, even if I would have
its likely I would have missed all of the implications
of reusing the dump infrastructure for this.

I have not applied Pablos patch to revert the "timeout reset"
because its relatively fresh compared to the other patches
in the batch (and the batch is already large enough).

But I do agree with having a separate facility for timeout
resets (timeout updates) would be better.

I also think we need to find a different strategy for the
dump-and-reset part when the reset could be interrupted
by a transaction.

ATM userspace would have to add a userspace lock like
iptables-legacy to prevent any generation id changes while
a "reset dump" is happening and I hope we can all agree that
this is something we definitely do not want :-)
