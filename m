[*] (more below)

 some problems running SCTP client endpoints behind NAT (inside Kubernetes =

, proposes to encrypt all SCTP chunks, conntrack will only be able to see S=
CTP common header, these changes hopefully will make it easier to adapt to =
such changes in SCTP protocol

If this is really the case, then I'm confused by this new RFC (be
warned I don't know the gory details of DTLS). I don't see it
specifying that other chunk headers will be encrypted, but instead I
see texts like:

3.7.  Message Sizes

   ...
   The sequence of DTLS records is then fragmented into DATA or I-DATA
   Chunks to fit the path MTU by SCTP.  These changes ensure that DTLS/
   SCTP has the same capability as SCTP to support user messages of any
   size. ...

this is just packing encrypted payload.

Sections 4.1 and 4.5 also lead to that, and:

6.  DTLS over SCTP Service

   The adoption of DTLS over SCTP according to the current specification
   is meant to add to SCTP the option for transferring encrypted data.
   When DTLS over SCTP is used, all data being transferred MUST be
   protected by chunk authentication and DTLS encrypted.

and finally:

9.6.  Privacy Considerations

   For each SCTP user message, the user also provides a stream
   identifier, a flag to indicate whether the message is sent ordered or
   unordered, and a payload protocol identifier.  Although DTLS/SCTP
   provides privacy for the actual user message, the other three
   information fields are not confidentiality protected.  They are sent
   as clear text because they are part of the SCTP DATA chunk header.


So AFAICU the claim here is that a middle box wouldn't be able to
inspect SCTP payload, but the protocol itself is still possible.
Did I miss something maybe?

secondary path

This a good change and may, actually, be the core reasoning behind the
change here. 'Primary' is more in the sense of 'active' than anything
else (and it gets more confusing with CMT-SCTP heh). It's not because
a path saw the INIT handshake that it is more reliable and so from
conntrack side.

With that, conntrack handling all paths similarly makes it more
consistent and closer with what the actual SCTP sockets are seeing for
such paths.

One easy example here of a bad situation due to the current difference
between paths is that an application can start an association through
a path and tear it down over another one. There's no shutdown seen by
the first path, and the conntrack entry will be left there af it is
was in Established state for 5 days. (this is also illustrated in
Sriram's example below, just easier to read)

Item I marked with [*] above is vague. You need to consider what it
would be loosing by such simplification and argument that it is okay.
We can't just cut the fat out and pray for the best later on, right?
But with this description here, it not only provides a solid
justification on why it (specificly the new solution) is needed but
also why it is currently already broken/not reliable in multi-homing
setups. Yay! :-)

Then, next question is: would it make sense to keep the current
processing for single path associations? That's a lot of
code/maintenance and I fail to see a reasoning that justifies it.
