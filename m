Probably you can collect some numbers to make sure this is not a
theoretical issue.

Are you proposing a new batching mechanism?

I see. Thanks for telling me.

As I said, you can place several netlink messages in one single
sendmsg() call, then they do not need to be contiguous.

What API are you refering to specifically?
