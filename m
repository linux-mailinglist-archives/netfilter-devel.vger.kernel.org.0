Hi, I guess we had a very similar conversation with the sig-network guys.

Please see below some comments.

Here you're going to have the same problems with iptables, lack of
scalability and complexity during rules removal. In nftlb we create
maps and with the same rules, you only have to take care of insert and
remove elements in them.

Some extensive examples here:

https://github.com/zevenet/nftlb/tree/master/tests

In regards to the ip : port natting, is not possible to use 2 maps
cause you need to generate numgen per each one and it will come to
different numbers.

Cheers.
