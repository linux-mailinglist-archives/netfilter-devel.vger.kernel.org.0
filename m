OK, so this fix only works with --noflush.

If --noflush is not specified, then it should be possible to extend
the cache to dump the chains, get the existing policy and use it.
There is now a phase to evaluate the cache requirements, so you can
fetch this. Then, from the netlink phase, look up for the existing
policy in the cache and use it.

OK, so this needs two more fixed on top of this one.
