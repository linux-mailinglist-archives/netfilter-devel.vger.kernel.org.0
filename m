So you're saying the overhead when printing a rule might be more
significant than when fetching it. I doubt this simply because the same
rule is usually printed at most once and there are multiple other
commands requiring a rule cache.

IMO we may also just leave the code as-is and wait for someone to
complain about bad performance with rulesets containing many compat
expressions. Depending on the actual report, we may also follow a hybrid
approach and do the match/target lookup only when needed and cache it
for later use.

My patch made most sense with an nft in mind which does not need xtables
support for saving/restoring compat expressions. Users depending on this
for whatever reason will execute the xlate code path in any case now.

Cheers, Phil
