Yes, at least I can imagine people relying upon this behaviour.

I even find it unintuitive as it retains state despite flushing. But
that is a significant divergence between legacy and nft:

| # iptables -P FORWARD DROP
| # iptables-restore <<EOF
| *filter
| COMMIT
| EOF
| # iptables-save

With legacy, the output is:

| *filter
| :INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
| :FORWARD DROP [0:0]
| :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
| COMMIT

With nft, there's no output at all. What do you think, should we fix
that? If so, which side?

Sure, no problem.

Thanks, Phil
