Sorry, I don't see the usecase for different deltas.
But even if we assume that, kernel already takes the dnat target port
number from a register.

... so I don't see why we need a new port-shift flag at all.
I think best approach is to provide the actual new dport in a register,
like we already do right now.

So we need an 'add' operation in kernel to compute

portreg = sreg_with_port + sreg_with_offset

See above.  I don't think we should go with the existing NAT flag,
its very much a hack to overcome iptables design limitations.
