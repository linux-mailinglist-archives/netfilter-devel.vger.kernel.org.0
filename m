From: Joao Moreira <joao.moreira@intel.com>

Both flow_rule_alloc and offload_action_alloc functions received an
unsigned num_actions parameters which are then operated within a loop.
The index of this loop is declared as a signed int. If it was possible
to pass a large enough num_actions to these functions, it would lead to
an out of bounds write.

After checking with maintainers, it was mentioned that front-end will
cap the num_actions value and that it is not possible to reach this
function with such a large number. Yet, for correctness, it is still
better to fix this.

This issue was observed by the commit author while reviewing a write-up
regarding a CVE within the same subsystem [1].
