I thought SRv6 processing to be the same as encapsulation/decapsulation
processing and I implemented patch this way intentionally.

I considered srv6 Behaviors (e.g. T.Encaps) to be the same as the =
encapsulation
in other tunneling protocols, and srv6local Behaviors (e.g. End, =
End.DT4,
End.DT6, ...) to be the same as the decapsulation in other tunneling =
protocols
even if decapsulation isn't happened. I'm intended that SRv6 packets =
whose
destination address is SRv6 End Behavior go through INPUT path.

I think it works correctly on your situation with the following rule:

ip6tables -A INPUT --dst fc01::2 -j ACCEPT

To say more generally, SRv6 locator blocks should be allowed with =
ip6tables if
you want to change default policy of INPUT chain to DROP/REJECT.
