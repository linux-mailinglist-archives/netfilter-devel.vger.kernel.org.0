I think it isn't a concurrent access.  We observed that userspace program
reads the remaining timeout and sets it back for unconfirmed conntrack.

Conceptually, it looks like:
timeout = nf_ct_expires(...);  (1)
ctnetlink_change_timeout(...timeout);

At (1), `nfct_time_stamp` is wrongly involved in the calculation[4] because
the conntrack is unconfirmed.  The `ct->timeout` is an internal but not a
timestamp.

As a result, ctnetlink_change_timeout() sets the wrong value to `ct->timeout`.

Again, that's why v1 separates all `ct->timeout` accesses.

If the conntrack is confirmed:
- `ct->timeout` is a timestamp.
- `nfct_time_stamp` should be involved when getting/setting `ct->timeout`.

If the conntrack is unconfirmed:
- `ct->timeout` is an interval.
- `nfct_time_stamp` shouldn't be involved.

Only separate `ct->timeout` access in __nf_ct_set_timeout() is obviously
insufficient.  I would suggest either take care of all `ct->timeout`
accesses as v1 or at least change both __nf_ct_set_timeout() and
nf_ct_expires().

In the latter case, it looks fine in our environment.  However, I'm not
sure if any hidden cases we haven't seen.
