Making such simple helper more generic might not be worth it.  Landlock
doesn't handle a lot of different "objects".

Correct, this is mostly useful for developers when changing the kernel
code.  We'll remove this kind of check when we'll have a proper struct
landlock_domain. ;)

Yes, we are continuing the discussion there.
