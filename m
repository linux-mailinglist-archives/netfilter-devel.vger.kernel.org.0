I was about to send v2 of this patch, but I found following comment in
ulogd source code (input/flow/ulogd_inpflow_NFCT.c):

 *      - add nanosecond-accurate packet receive timestamp of event-changing
 *        packets to {ip,nf}_conntrack_netlink, so we can have accurate IPFIX
 *        flowStart / flowEnd NanoSeconds.


I'm leaning towards reworking this patch to replace ktime_get_real_ns()
by

ktime_to_ns(skb_tstamp_cond(skb, 1)))

so that the event carries the packet receive timestamp if that was
available or the current clock time as fallback.

Thoughts?  Otherwise I can ignore above comment and keep
ktime_get_real_ns() usage.
