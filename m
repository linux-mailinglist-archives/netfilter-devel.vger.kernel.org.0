I hesitate on changing --stateless behaviour, but I don't find a
usecase for this option all alone unless it is combined with --terse,
to store an initial ruleset skeleton with no elements and no states.
Sets with timeout likely contain elements that get dynamically added
either via control plane or packet path based on some heuristics.

I think it is fine as it is now in the kernel. I have posted patches
to allow to update element timeouts via transaction, which looks more
flexible and run through the transaction path. As for counter and
quota, users likely only want to either: 1) restore a previous state
(after reboot) or 2) dump-and-reset counters for stats collection
(e.g. fetch counters at the end of the day).
