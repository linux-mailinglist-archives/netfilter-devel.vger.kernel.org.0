I dislike this oneliners to update comments, I tend to think it's too
much overhead a patch just to update something obvious to the reader.

However, I also understand you may want to fix this while passing by
here.

So my sugggestion is that you run:

        git grep ip_conntrack

in the tree, searching for comments and documentation that can be
updated, eg.

net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_icmp.c:        /* See ip_conntrack_proto_tcp.c */

Please, only update comments / documentation in your patch.

The ip_conntrack_ prefix is legacy, that it was used by the time there
was only support for IPv4 in the connection tracking system.

Thanks.
