While it is true that no zero-copy mechanisms are used by
libmnl/libnftnl, an early improvement I did was to max out receive
buffer size (see commit 5a0294901db1d which also has some figures).
After all though, I would consider this to be mostly relevant when
loading a large ruleset and that is rather a one-time action, for
instance during system boot-up.

Some "quick changes" like, e.g. adding an IP to a blacklist, usually
don't need to push much data to the kernel for zero-copy to become
relevant. (Of course they may still benefit if setup overhead can be
kept low).

Not really. I did some runtime measurements once but unless there's an
undiscovered performance loop I wouldn't expect much to improve there.

Obviously, a much larger factor is ruleset design. I guess most
existing, legacy rulesets out there would largely benefit from
introducing ipset. Duplicating the same crappy ruleset in nftables is
pointless. Making it use nftables' features after the conversion is not
trivial, but results aren't even comparable afterwards. At least that's
my quintessence from trying, see the related blog[1] for details.

Cheers, Phil
