Great, thanks!

Since there is already another branch in this macro I take it the issue is
the part where we return now, right?

I can see how this is kind of nasty being completely implicit and all, how
about using a label and passing the name to the macro? Something like:

    ret = snprintf(...)
    BUFFER_SIZE_ERR(ret, size, len, offset, err);
    [...]
    err:
        return -1;
