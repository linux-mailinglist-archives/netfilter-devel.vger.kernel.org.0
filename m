Obviously, yes, but irrelevant for this discussion. A script won't be
able to identify two different looking rules as identical because of
semantics.

I was just picking up your argument: Above, you wrote "Other than that,
it's a bug". I assume that in "return an input that is equal to the
output plus the handle", equal really means equal and not equivalent.

I am assuming that a script that uses echo mode wants to update the
input ruleset (snippet) with handles for later reference to the added
rules. Other than copying output to input completely, it will have to
iterate through output and extract the handle properties, identifying
it's own rules based on current index. More or less what libnftables is
doing when updating JSON input with handles.

Eric suggested to accept a "cookie" property with arbitrary value to
stay in place at least for echo output. He even suggested to accept this
as an alternative to the handle for rule referencing. The latter would
need kernel support, though.

I know, I wrote the code.

We don't need, but seems we want. We have JSON output and JSON echo for
a while now and code for both is distinct. I fail to see why this was OK
but is no longer. From my perspective, Jose simply failed to see that
JSON output code should be used for JSON echo if input is not JSON.

I could come up with a patch implementing that if all this is merely
about the missing feature.

That is not a sensible use-case. For once, I would assume native syntax
to be used by humans, so if this is combined with JSON output, the goal
is translation. If input really comes from a script, it is likely not
retaining the input for later reuse but will take whatever it receives
back.

Cheers, Phil
