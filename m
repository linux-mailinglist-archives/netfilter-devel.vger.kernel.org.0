It requires kernel support and the pf.os file in place, yes.

This requires kernel support, yes.

We have tests/py/ as unit tests, if that might look similar to what

I would like to make a release before such change is applied, build
infrastructure and python support was messy in the previous release.
Then we look into this, OK?
