But the packet path doesn't grab the table mutex.

I don't see how this changes anything wrt. packet path.
This disallows another instance of iptables(-restore) to come in
before the counters have been copied/freed and the destructors have run.

But as those have nothing to do with the jumpstack I don't see how this
helps.
