That was my suspicion as well, but while testing I found out that no
matter what I passed to 'get element', I couldn't provoke a situation in
which get_set_interval_find() would have left and right elements which
didn't match exactly (or not at all).

There must be some preparation happening before the call to
get_set_decompose() which normalizes things. And still, If I disable the
call to get_set_decompose() entirely, tests start failing.

Cheers, Phil
