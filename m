OK, so as per "E3-example", you're saying that if E2 expires during
the transaction, then if F_EXCL is given the transaction will fail while
otherwise it will be re-added.

True.  Am I correct that we can't implement the "expand" via
del+add because of stateful objects?

I fear we will need to circle back to rbtree then, I'll followup
there (wrt. on-demand gc).

Got it.
