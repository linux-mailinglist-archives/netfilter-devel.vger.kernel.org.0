I'm not proposing to use this approach for _every key_. For this one
specifically I think it's meaningful to have a NFT_META_BRI_IIFVLAN
since vlan is an optional configuration.

I think disallowing 'meta oifgroup 0' from prerouting (and the input
path in general) is fine from the control plane configuration, but you
know Florian disagrees with this. Probably this can be left as is for
IIFNAME and OIFNAME, which as used by iptables-nft for compatibility
with legacy. For new keys, check for invalid configuration I would
argue that is fine.

But let's wait for Florian to say what he thinks :-)
