I wonder how likely it is for someone to rely upon the behaviour. I can
imagine a script passing an empty interface name and expecting the
argument to be ignored (patch 13). Though what are the odds someone
actually calls arptables with '-m something' (patch 14) or a bogus table
name (patch 15)?

If that's OK with you, I would turn the empty interface name error into
a warning for arptables-nft, reintroduce the warning for intrapositioned
negations and drop the remaining quirks as they are likely hiding a bug.

Cheers, Phil
