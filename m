How did you handle that, before the recent addition of the skip
functionality? Did you just have a list of known failures, and manually
ignored them?


Anyway, the "eval-exit-code" in v2 can easily honor an environment
variable, to always fail hard. The only question is how exactly it
should work.

I propse that NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP=3Dy should honor a variable
"NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP_EXCEPT=3D", which takes a regex of test names, for
which a skip is *not* fatal (you opt-in the tests that are allowed to
fail). If you maintain c9s, the list of known skipped tests is small
and relatively static. You can maintain a per-kernel-variant regex in
that case.

If we want, we can even parse /etc/os-release and uname and code a
default list of regexes.

I think it is good to merge tests soon. There just needs to be a
reasonable+convenient way to handle the problem.

Having a policy that requires you to wait is broken. Especially, since
it's unclear how long to wait. You are not waiting for yourself, but
for any unknown user who is affected.

I think the kernel versions work reasonably well for upstream and
Fedora kernels (which is something already!).

I guess, there could be a smarter

  "$NFT_TEST_BASEDIR/helpers/eval-exit-code" kernel  upstream-6.6  upstream=
-6.5.6  c9s-5.14.0-373

that also can cover different "streams" (e.g. the uname from a centos).
But I like a NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP_EXCEPT=3D better.

Also, at worst on the Frankenkernel you get a SKIP, when it should have
been a FAIL. For the non-expert user who writes a patch to fix a type
the SKIP is better during `make check`.

On upstream/Fedora kernels, you also don't need anything, and "eval-
exit-code" will end up doing the right thing automatically.

And if you maintain CentOS9Stream, then set NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP=3Dy and
NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP_EXCEPT=3D<REGEX> and keep track of the tests that
are known to fail. You know your kernel, and the tests that are known
to be skipped.

How about that?

I like the optimism :)
