Thanks.

I have posted an alternative patch to move the handling of
NF_FLOW_HW_ESTABLISHED, which is specific for sched/act_ct:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20231024193815.1987-1-pablo@netfilter.org/

it is a bit more code, but it makes it easier to understand for the
code reader that this bit is net/sched specific.
