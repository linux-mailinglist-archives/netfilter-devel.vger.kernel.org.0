The changes are not clear to me so I don't know.  If a lot of parts are
changed, maybe splitting this patch into a few patches would help.  I'm
a bit worried that too much parts are changed though.

When I try to apply this series I get:

  Patch failed at 0002 landlock: Make network stack layer checks explicit
  for each TCP action
  error: patch failed: security/landlock/net.c:1
  error: security/landlock/net.c: patch does not apply
