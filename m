There is not enough information here to answer this question,

I'm not sure what you mean or what you expect to happen.

Do you mean "segments"?  Its the other way around, with GSO/TSO, stack
builds large superpackes, one tcp header with lots of data.

Such superpackets are split at the last possible moment;
ideally by NIC/hardware.

GSO is just the software fallback of TSO, i.e. local stack passes
large skb down to the driver which will do pseudo segmentation,
this needs hardware that can handle scatterlist, which is true for
almost all nics.

There is some segmentation support for UDP to handle encapsulation
(tunneling) use cases, where stack can pass large skb and then can
have hardware or software fallback do the segmentation for us, i.e.
split according to inner protocol and add the outer udp encapsulation
to all packets.

You are sending a large udp packet via ipv6, it doesn't fit the device mtu,
fragmentation is needed.  This has nothing to do with GSO.

Stack built a larger packet, device or software fallback will segment
them as needed.

It would help if you could explain what is wrong here.

You also removed tcpdump info, I suspect it was "flags [+]"
with two fragments for udp:ipv4 too?

Frag handling depends on a lot of factors, such as ip defrag being
enabled or not, where queueing happens (hook and prio), if userspace
does mtu probing (like 'ping6 -M do') or not.

And the NIC driver too.

For incoming data it also depends on sysctl settings and if
GRO/LRO is enabled.

Kernel does software segmentation here, this is slow.
