Applied remaining patches with comments.

- Patch #20, #24 maybe consider conversion to snprintf at some point, not
  your fault, this code is using sprintf in many spots. I think the
  only problematic scenario which might trigger problems is the
  configuration path using too long object names.

- Patch #21, #22 and #25, maybe consolidate this database field from
  _ to . in a common function.

- Patch #27, tm_gmtoff mod 86400 is really required? tm_gmtoff can be
  either -12/+12 * 60 * 60, simple assignment to integer should calm
  down the compiler?

- Patch #80, I guess you picked 80 just to provide a sufficiently
  large buffer to calm down compiler.

- Patch #31: I have replaced this patch with a check from .start and
  .signal paths to validate the unix socket path. The signal path of
  ulogd2 is problematic since configuration file errors should
  likely stop the daemon. I'll post it after this email.

- Patch #32: this IPFIX plugin was tested with wireshark according to
  4f639231c83b ("IPFIX: Add IPFIX output plugin"), I wonder if this
  attribute((packed)) is breaking anything, or maybe this was all
  tested on 32-bit?

Anyway, after this update it's probably better to look at using
pkg-config in the build system.

Thanks for fixing up these compiler warnings.
