Okay, I understood.

No, you only need to add single rule for accepting these SIDs. Here is =
the
quote of RFC 8986.

---
This document defines an SRv6 SID as consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG, where
a locator (LOC) is encoded in the L most significant bits of the SID,
followed by F bits of function (FUNCT) and A bits of arguments (ARG). L,
the locator length, is flexible, and an operator is free to use the =
locator
length of their choice. F and A may be any value as long as L+F+A <=3D =
128.
When L+F+A is less than 128, then the remaining bits of the SID MUST be
zero.

A locator may be represented as B:N where B is the SRv6 SID block (IPv6
prefix allocated for SRv6 SIDs by the operator) and N is the identifier =
of
the parent node instantiating the SID.

When the LOC part of the SRv6 SIDs is routable, it leads to the node, =
which
instantiates the SID.
---

If there are 100 SIDs, but these SIDs are for the same node, the =
locators
of these SIDs also should be same. so, you can allow SRv6 flows by =
adding
only single rule.

You stated this patch isn't acceptable because NF_HOOK is called even =
when
End behavior is processing, aren't you? So, do you think it=E2=80=99s =
natural that
NF_HOOK is called *only* when SRv6 behavior is encap/decap operation. =
The
problem I stated first is that netfilter couldn't track inner flows of
SRv6-encapsulated packets regardless of the status of IPv6 conntrack. If
yes, I will fix and resubmit patch.
