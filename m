The testsuite relies upon Python and respective modules already, using
jq introduces a new dependency. Hence why I suggested to write a script.

JSON object attributes are not bound to any ordering, the code may
change it.

When analyzing testsuite failures, a diff of two overlong lines is
inconvenient to the point that one may pipe both through json_pp and
then diff again. The testsuite may do just that in case of offending
output, but the problem of reordered attributes remains.

I'd really appreciate if testsuite changes prioritized usability. I
rather focus on fixing bugs instead of parsing the testsuite results.

Cheers, Phil
