No idea, I won't change anything. V1 kept '-X' behaviour as-is:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20210814174643.130760-1-fw@strlen.de/

see the "don't delete built-in chain" comment, the reject-check was kept
in place for the case where iptables-nft is iterating over all the
chains; explict '-X $NAME' was required.

So I don't know what I should change now.  Feel free to update
as you see fit, including a revert.
