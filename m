pos is always &xtables_pending_matches:

- The first element in the array finds no matching, then:

        if (!*pos)
               pos = &xtables_pending_matches;

  kicks in and and pos is set to &xtables_pending_matches, so this is
  inserted in the first position of the xtables_pending_matches.

- The follow up element in the array (higher revision) finds itself at
  the very beginning of the iteration, so pos here is
  &xtables_pending_matches too.

So *pos = me; is always updating the next pointer in the
xtables_pending_matches.

Same picture you're describing? I just found a bit confusing that this
is using *pos = me to refresh xtables_pending_matches, probably you
can just use

xtables_pending_matches = me;

I would add a bug check somewhere too in case that an extension is
not inserted in the first position, *pos = me won't work in that case.

May I suggest you please extend the commit message a bit to describe
this logic?

This is optimizing userspace for more recent kernels, that sounds
reasonable.
