As you probably run a self-built kernel, wouldn't you just `export
NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP=3Dy` and reject all skips as failures? What's the
problem with that? That exists exactly for your use case.

The test suite should be usable on some recent + popular distro kernels
(like Fedora 38). That will also be rather important, once the tests
are invoked by `make check` (I have patches for that, it's very simple
and rather nice!).

OK, do you intend to fix this bug in a very timely manner on Fedora 38
(and other popular kernels)? Then maybe hold back the test until that
happend? (or let it skip for now, and in a few weeks, upgrade to hard
failure -- the only problem is not to forget about that).

Ah right. "tests/shell/testcases/transactions/table_onoff" is fixed on
6.5.6-200.fc38.x86_64. There still is a general problem. For example
what about tests/shell/testcases/packetpath/vlan_8021ad_tag ?



Maybe there could be two levels of NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP. Maybe
"always" or "bugs-only". Then either:

1) the test would exit 78 instead of 77. And run-test.sh would treat 78
either as failure or as skip, based on NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP

2) the test itself could look at NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP and decide
whether to exit with 77 or 1.


Or how about adding a mechanism, that compares the kernel version and
decides whether to skip? For example


if ! printf "%s" "$OUT" | grep -q 'counter packets 1 bytes 84' ; then
    echo "Filter did not match. Assume kernel lacks fix https://git.kernel.=
org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3Daf84f9e447a65b=
4b9f79e7e5d69e19039b431c56"
    "$NFT_TEST_BASEDIR/helpers/eval-exit-code" kernel 6.5.6 || exit $?
fi


where "eval-exit-code" will either exit with 1 or 77 and log a message
(about the result of the comparison).

The "kernel" arguments indicates to compare the `uname` output in some
useful >=3D way.



How about "eval-exit-code"?
