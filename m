By the way, now nftables should natively support all the features from
ipset.

My plan (for which I haven't found the time in months) would be to
write some kind of "reference" wrapper to create nftables sets from
ipset commands, and to render them back as ipset-style output.

I wonder if this should become the job of iptables-nft, eventually.
