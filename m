Sounds like over-engineering, although your point is valid, of course.
In iptables shell testsuite was changed to always call unshare back in
2018, I don't think anyone has complained yet. So either everyone has
netns support already (likely, given the container inflation) or nobody
apart from hardliners actually run those tests (even more likely). :)

Maybe support a hidden parameter and do a self-call wrapped by 'unshare'
unless that parameter was passed?
