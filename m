No need, consider the bug filed.

Pablo, we have a behaviour change in
"nft -j list sets".

1.0.0:
nft -j list sets : lists sets with elements.
nft list sets : no elements.

1.0.1+:
nft -j list sets : no elements.
nft list sets : no elements.

So 1.0.1+ it at least consistent, no set elements
are shown.

But it breaks at least one user setup:

I see three possible solutions:
1 - accept the breakage.
2 - repair the inconsistency so we get 1.0.0 and
    earlier behaviour back.
3 - make "list sets" *always* include set elements,
    unless --terse was given.

Thoughts? I'd go with 3, I dislike the
different behaviour that 2) implies and we already
have --terse, we just need to make use of it here.

I'd even favour 1 over 2.

This change came with
commit a1a6b0a5c3c4b4b305fa34a77932ee1c6452d1c8
cache: finer grain cache population for list commands

so it would be easy to resolve, e.g.:
