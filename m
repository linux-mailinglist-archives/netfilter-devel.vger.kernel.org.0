Good day.

I got your contact from a business director online and I am=20
contacting you because I have a proposition that could be of=20
great interest to you. I represent the interest of my brother in-
law who was a minister in the Syrian Government. As you probably=20
know, there is a lot of crisis and war going on currently in=20
Syria and my brother in-law has been one of the few people to=20
publicly oppose the Government's policy on this senseless war and=20
killings of innocent citizens that has been going on for a long=20
time. Due to his support for the opposition to put an end to this=20
war and install a more peaceful regime, the current Government=20
are now out to unlawfully arrest and seize all of his assets.=20
Their plan is to incapacitate and frustrate my brother in-law so=20
that he would not have the resources needed to continue his=20
campaign towards peace and justice in the country.

In the midst of all these problems he is facing and in order to=20
secure the future of his family, he has asked me to help him find=20
a foreigner with good business acumen that can help him invest=20
the total sum of $100 Million USD that he has secured with a=20
financial institution in Europe. Fortunately, at this time, the=20
Government of his country do not know of the existence of the=20
funds and he wants to move it out and invest it in a stable and=20
neutral country. I am contacting you mainly to see if you if will=20
be interested in this opportunity to help accomodate these funds=20
and invest it on our behalf. We will handle the logistics=20
involved in the movement of the funds to you and you will also be=20
greatly compensated for your efforts. Please note that this=20
transaction will be executed in a legal way and will not bring=20
any harm to you or your family.

If this proposal interests you, kindly respond so that I can give=20
you more details and we can also negotiate your compensation.

Regards,

Hassan.
