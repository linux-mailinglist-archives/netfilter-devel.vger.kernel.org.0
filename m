Ugh, sorry, but that sounds just wrong.

Hmm, I don't understand WHY this requirement exists, since endpoints
cannot control source port (or source address) seen by the peer;
NAT won't go away.

I read that snippet several times and its not clear to me if
"port number" refers to sport or dport.  Dport would make sense to me,
but sport...?  No, not really.

Won't the endpoints notice that the path is down and re-create the flow?

AFAIU the root cause of your problem is that:
1. NAT middleboxes remap source port AND
2. NAT middleboxes restart frequently

... so fixing either 1 or 2 would avoid the problem.

I don't think adding sysctls to override 1) is a sane option.

We can't fix the ruleset but we can somehow cure it via sysctl in each netns?
I don't like this.

NAT middlebox restart with --random is a problem in any case, not just
for SCTP, because the chosen "random port" is lost.

I don't see a way to fix this, unless NOT using --random mode.
If connection is subject to sequence number rewrite (for tcp)
the connection won't survive either as the sejadj state is lost.
