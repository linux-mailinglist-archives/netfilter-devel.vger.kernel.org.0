It's possible, there's for example:
https://github.com/mk-fg/systemd-cgroup-nftables-policy-manager
https://github.com/helsinki-systems/nft_cgroupv2/

But I think that with this approach, depending on system load, there 
could be a vulnerable time window where the rules aren't loaded yet but 
the process which is supposed to be protected by the rules has already 
started running. This isn't desirable for firewalls, so I'd like to have 
a way for loading the firewall rules as early as possible.
