Yes, ipset treats all uxx types as netorder.

It checks the presence of the NLA_F_NET_BYTEORDER, see the 
ip_set_attr_netorder() and ip_set_optattr_netorder() functions in 
include/linux/netfilter/ipset/ip_set.h which are then used at input 
validation.

The userspace tool also uses and checks the flag in lib/session.c, but it 
accepts hostorder as well.
