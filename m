I'm glad. If you have suggestions for how to make the wiki clearer I'd 
love to hear them. (Probably better to use the regular netfilter list, 
where developers are also present, rather than this netfilter-devel list.)

Yes, nftables & the rest of netfilter (defrag, conntrack, nat, etc) use 
the same hooks. And relative priority within a hook determines the order 
in which the various processes _at that hook_ happen.

I think such hinting is the idea, yes.

Just to be clear, NF_IP_PRI_NAT_SRC is a named constant in the netfilter 
codebase. So not something you can change unless you edit the source 
code and compile it yourself. But you could create a base chain using 
"hook postrouting priority -400" and add rules with "snat to" statements 
to said chain, and this will happily snat your packets as you specify. 
Whether this overall config does what you want, depends on what else is 
hooked to postrouting, and their relative priorities. For example:

* Conntrack is almost always used. Using -400 for snat doesn't change 
its relative order to NF_IP_PRI_CONNTRACK_HELPER and 
NF_IP_PRI_CONNTRACK_CONFIRM (both of which are also at postrouting hook).

* If you are also mangling packets (in ways other than snat) at 
postrouting, NF_IP_PRI_MANGLE = -150. By moving your snat from usual 100 
to -400, you've re-ordered the mangle and snat processes -- unless you 
also use a nonstandard priority for your base chain that does mangling.

* There's also NF_IP_PRI_SECURITY, maybe important if you're using SELINUX.

General point: you should have a good reason for using priorities other 
than the traditional ones.

It's pretty common to filter in prerouting. And maybe to set secmark as 
well... So using priority 0 or 500 for dnat could cause trouble. Using 
-250 for dnat is problematic for the reason you state. And if you're 
using SELINUX you also have to consider NF_IP_PRI_SELINUX_FIRST at -225.

I think you mean?:
