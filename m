It doesn't do a full scan though.

Maybe lets take two steps back.  What is the actual issue that
needs to be resolved?

Even if nelems/count is dumped while concealing the
rbtree details, then its still confusing, you get
nelems 42 but no (or fewer) elements = { ... dumped
due to the timeout thing.

So in case we have to document that nelems/count isn't
the number of active elements but stored elements, including
the inactive ones, then we might as well not export this
and instead document consequence of large gc interval.

We could also do something even simpler: when we hit
size limit on dataplane insertion for TIMEOUT element,
expedite next gc scan if gc interval is > 10s (or some
other value -- don't want constant scans when set is full
with no timed out elements).

pipapo has other issues, just compare insert and delete times
of pipapo or hash or rbtree.

Even if thats not a concern, ATM userspace cannot force pipapo even if
it wanted to, so this is moot anyway.

Only if this fixup stuff is done in the kernel, which sabotages
debug output (conceals actual elements by some strategy rather
than just expose set->nelems).

OK.
