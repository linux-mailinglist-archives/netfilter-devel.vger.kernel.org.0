No idea, its certainly bad design (iptables-restore exists for a
reason).

Agreed.

iptables-nft uses the nftables netlink API, I don't think it suffers
from the preempt_rt issues you're resolving in the setsockopt api.

It won't go anywhere near xt_replace_table and it doesn't use the
xtables binary format on the user/kernel api side.

Good question.  What I can gather from
https://git.netfilter.org/iptables/tree/libiptc/libiptc.c#n2597

After replace we get copy of the old counters, depending on mode
we can force-update counters post-replace in kernel, via

	ret = setsockopt(handle->sockfd, TC_IPPROTO, SO_SET_ADD_COUNTERS,
			 newcounters, counterlen);

I suspect this is whats used by 'iptables -L -v -Z INPUT'.
But I don't know if anyone uses this in practice.

Maybe Pablo remembers the details, this is ancient code by kernel
standards.

I think we might get away with losing counters on the update
side, i.e. rcu_update_pointer() so new CPUs won't find the old
binary blob, copy the counters, then defer destruction via rcu_work
or similar and accept that the counters might have marginally
changed after the copy to userland and before last cpu left its
rcu critical section.
