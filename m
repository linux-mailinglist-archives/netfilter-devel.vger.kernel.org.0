I made a bit of digging in the history, and we already pulled the 4
digits handle in the past for iptables.

https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/files/changes-iptables-1.4.19.1.txt

As for 0.9.10, it would skip 0.9.9:

$ git log --oneline v0.9.8..v0.9.9 | wc -l
150

We can start with a few -stable branches, namely 0.9.8.y and 1.0.6.y
as it has been suggested, I am going to push patches to the branches,
I will keep you posted.
