So it does currently in a normal process exit.

Reading all this, a few choices:

- add an 'orphan' flag that gets set on if the owner process goes
  away, so only ruleset with such flag can be retaken. This is to
  avoid allowing a process to take any other ruleset in place.

- add another flag to keep the ruleset around when the owner process
  goes away.

Probably it can be the same flag for both cases.

I remember we discussed these superficially at the time that the
'owner' flag was introduced, but there were not many use-cases in
place already, and the goal for the 'owner' flag is to prevent an
accidental zapping of the ruleset via 'nft flush ruleset' by another
process.

I think this 'persist' flag provides semantics the described above,
that is:

- keep it in place if process goes away.
- allow to retake ownership.
