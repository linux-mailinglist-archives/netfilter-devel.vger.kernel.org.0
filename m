Yes.

Several seconds is very strange indeed, how is the data that needs
to be transferred to userspace and how large is the buffer provided
during dumps? strace would help here.

If thats rather small, then dumping a chain with 10k rules may
have to re-iterate the existig list for long time before it finds
the starting point on where to resume the dump.

I can't think of a good solution.  We could add a
"--allow-inconsistent-dump" flag to nftables that disables the restart
logic for -EINTR case, but we can't make that the default unfortunately.

Or we could experiment with serializing the remaining rules into a
private kernel-side kmalloc'd buffer once the userspace buffer is
full, then copy from that buffer on resume without the inconsistency check.

I don't think that we can solve this, slowing down writers when there
are dumpers will load to the same issue, just in the oppostite direction.
