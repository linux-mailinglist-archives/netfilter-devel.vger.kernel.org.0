Well, here is a more accurate and generic definition (using "scope"):

A Landlock rule describes a set of actions intended by a task on a scope 
of objects.  A set of rules is aggregated in a ruleset, which can then 
restrict the thread enforcing it, and its future children.

The two existing types of rules are:

Filesystem rules
     For these rules, the scope of objects is a file hierarchy,
     and the related filesystem actions are defined with
     `filesystem access rights`.

Network rules (since ABI v4)
     For these rules, the scope of objects is the sockets identified
     with a TCP (bind or connect) port according to the related
     `network access rights`.


What do you think?
