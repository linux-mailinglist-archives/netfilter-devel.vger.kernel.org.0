Subject: [PATCH nft] tests: 0043concatenated_ranges_0: Fix checks for add/delete failures
Date:   Mon,  3 Aug 2020 16:06:39 +0200
Message-Id: <1201d76f21c3272d2e0db35326f3c64239f8a3dc.1596461357.git.sbrivio@redhat.com>

The test won't stop if we simply precede commands expected to fail
by !. POSIX.1-2017 says:

  -e
      When this option is on, if a simple command fails for any of
      the reasons listed in Consequences of Shell Errors or returns
      an exit status value >0, and is not part of the compound list
      following a while, until or if keyword, and is not a part of
      an AND or OR list, and is not a pipeline preceded by the "!"
      reserved word, then the shell will immediately exit.

...but I didn't care about the last part.

Replace those '! nft ...' commands by 'nft ... && exit 1' to actually
detect failures.

As a result, I didn't notice that now, correctly, inserting elements
into a set that contains the same exact element doesn't actually
fail, because nft doesn't pass NLM_F_EXCL on a simple 'add'. Drop
re-insertions from the checks we perform here, overlapping elements
are already covered by other tests.
