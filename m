For those reading this patch: Mikhail would like to have a way to
restore a batch of conntrack entries skipping failures in insertions
(currently, -I sets on NLM_F_CREATE), hence this new -A command.
The conntrack tool does not have create and add like nftables, it used
to have -I only. The mapping here is: -I means NLM_F_CREATE and -A
means no NLM_F_CREATE (report no error on EEXIST).

Could you add CT_ADD command type so we can save this flag?

You will have to update a few more spots in the code but this should
be fine.

Thanks.
