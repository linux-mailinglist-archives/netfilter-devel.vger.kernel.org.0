I really do not like the direction this is taking. pktb_build_data() is one of 4
new functions you are suggesting, the others being pktb_alloc_head(),
pktb_reset_network_header() and pktb_set_network_header(). In
https://www.spinics.net/lists/netfilter-devel/msg65830.html, you asked

That's what I have delivered, except for 2 extra args on the end for the packet
copy buffer. And I get rid of pktb_free(), or at least deprecate and move it off
the main doc page into the "Other functions" page.

Also pktb_set_network_header() makes no allowance for AF_BRIDGE. Can we please
just stick with

maybe with a better name for buf - data_copy_buf?

OK - will start on a patch based on
