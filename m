There is no principle problem to allow any executable/shebang. However,
it also not clear why we would want to use anything except bash.  Unless
we have a good reason, check and reject anything else.

Also not that `./tests/shell/run-tests.sh -x` only works if the shebang
is either "#!/bin/bash" or "#!/bin/bash -e". It probably could also work
with other tests, but it's unclear what they are and how to enable
verbose mode in that case.

Just check that they are all bash scripts. If there is a use-case, we
can always adjust this check.
