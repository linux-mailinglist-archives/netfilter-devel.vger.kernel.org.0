I'm attaching the patch... it's from 2017. It does not apply,
rule_add() in tests/py/nft-tests.py has changed quite a bit, since
there are tests for the netlink payload, json and so on.

I was basically checking if removing the rule that was possible to
make sure there is symmetry between add and delete.

I'm afraid you'll have to dig into tests/py file to update this.
