Comparing performance of various commands with equivalent iptables ones
I noticed that nftables fetches data from kernel it doesn't need in some
cases. For instance, listing one table was slowed down by a large other
table.

Since there is already code to filter data added to cache, make use of
that and craft GET requests to kernel a bit further so it returns only
what is needed.

This series is not entirely complete, e.g. objects are still fetched as
before. It rather converts some low hanging fruits.

Phil Sutter (5):
  cache: Filter tables on kernel side
  cache: Filter rule list on kernel side
  cache: Filter chain list on kernel side
  cache: Filter set list on server side
  cache: Support filtering for a specific flowtable
