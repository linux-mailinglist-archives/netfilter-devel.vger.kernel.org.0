Yes, but only because payload (and hence kernel data) remains the same.

IMHO, it's a controversy of whether we want to make the time match
respect DST changes or not:

It should, because when I restrict internet access to my kids after 8pm,
I don't want to touch my firewall's ruleset twice a year.

It needs not, because upon the next reboot things are correct again,
anyway.

It should not because otherwise once a year there are two spooky hours in
which things run twice that should never ever run more than once per
night. Apart from that, description of --kerneltz in
iptables-extensions(8) speaks for itself.

So long story short, it is always a problem no matter how it is solved.
:(

Cheers, Phil
