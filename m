It is all available in git annotate:

68310ba0f9c2 ("tests: shell: Search diff tool once and for all")
7d93e2c2fbc7 ("tests: shell: autogenerate dump verification")

I just need to move it around so I can use it from feature scripts.
If you prefer I can just use 'diff' instead from the feature scripts.
