It should be the same.

Only difference:

ctnetlink delete zaps entry right away, timeout-0 zaps it on the next
(matching) packet or when gc finds the entry (or on next conntrack -L),
whatever comes first.

Understood.

Yes, but thats because the packet that hits the timed-out flow zaps it
and is 'new' (for tcp_loose=1).

Yes, bypassing nfqueue was the original use-case that prompted the
connlabel feature.

There are several ways to do what you want.

You can add a 'requeue' named set:
   ct id @myset queue ...

and then add/remove from that set to (re)enable via userspace.

Or you can use opt-in (or out, its simpler) via mark or label:
  ct state new ct label set shouldqueue ...
  ct label shouldqueue queue ...

or, without need to set initial state:
  ct label ! "wasqueued" queue ...

... and then use ctnetlink to set the label (or clear it).

Or, set/clear the label from the nfqueue program itself when setting accept
verdict (via nested NFQA_CT + CTA_MARK/LABELS).

Same with connmark, but I know that this might be impossible
due to those being used for policy routing etc.

Setting the timeout to 0 zaps the entry at earliest opportunity,
it will not be "reactivated" on next packet, its just
conntrack --delete with minor random delay.
