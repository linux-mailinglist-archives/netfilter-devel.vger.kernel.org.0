It already is a single rule, but a single mapping, or one that appears
like one.  In reality, I use dynamic map @refs, of course.

A single lookup would avoid the problem that the key has changed in the
second lookup.

I played around, trying if I could "ip6 daddr . tcp dport set" and
perhaps have a map with elements like "{ $PREFIX::64:75 . 8080 :
$PREFIX::100:20 . 80 }" but did not find a syntax.  [I've been missing a
formal syntax, it's all examples so I wasn't sure if this was possible
at all.]  It'd look like

new_nft add rule ip6 raw prerouting \
   ip6 daddr . tcp dport set \
      ip6 daddr . tcp dport \
         map { $PREFIX::64:75 . 8080 : $PREFIX::100:20 . 80 }

Ah, you spotted the problem too.  No surprise ;-)

Yes, exactly.  That way, I can use two maps but find the right
combination of addr/port without intermediate key changes.

It is another possible way to get to the old value so I can make the
same mapping.

I could imagine storing the old daddr in daddr2 then mapping daddr and
using daddr2 in the second map looking to find the matching port.  That
might look like

new_nft add rule ip6 raw prerouting \
   rulevar set ip6 daddr \
   ip6 daddr set \
      ip6 daddr . tcp dport \
         map { $PREFIX::64:75 . 8080 : $PREFIX::100:20 } \
   tcp dport set \
      rulevar . tcp dport \
         map { $PREFIX::100:20 . 8080 : 80 } \

If the language internally uses a stack, I could imagine pushing the old
value(s) to prepare for the second map, then perform the first map and
continue with the second.  That might look like

new_nft add rule ip6 raw prerouting \
   ip6 daddr push \
   ip6 daddr set \
      ip6 daddr . tcp dport \
         map { $PREFIX::64:75 . 8080 : $PREFIX::100:20 } \
   tcp dport set \
      pop . tcp dport \
         map { $PREFIX::100:20 . 8080 : 80 } \


The examples are just three syntaxes I can think of.


Thanks,
