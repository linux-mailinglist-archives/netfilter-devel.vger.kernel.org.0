Hi Pablo,

Please consider to apply the next patches to the nf tree:

- When the support of destination MAC addresses for hash:mac sets was
  introduced, it was forgotten to add the same functionality to hash:ip,m=
ac
  types of sets. The patch from Stefano Brivio adds the missing part.
- When the support of destination MAC addresses for hash:mac sets was
  introduced, a copy&paste error was made in the code of the hash:ip,mac
  and bitmap:ip,mac types: the MAC address in these set types is in
  the second position and not in the first one. Stefano Brivio's patch
  fixes the issue.
- There was still a not properly handled concurrency handling issue
  between renaming and listing sets at the same time, reported by
  Shijie Luo.

Best regards,
Jozsef
