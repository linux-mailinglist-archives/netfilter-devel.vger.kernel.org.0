We can avoid this if we select the right buffer size for the --echo
case, to make this reliable. For events, that's a different case,
there is not much we can do in case this hits ENOBUFS, since we don't
know how much information the kernel will send to us, so we can just
report message losts to the users.

Setting a fixed size works around the problem, yes. But still we will
hit ENOBUFS at some point. I sent you a patch to start estimating the
size of the receiver buffer size in a simple way.

Please, send a patch to fix this, thanks!

Not sure what you mean.

Thanks for this testcase.
