Based on on the stack of the iptables-restore task that freed the 
jumpstack being accessed in the ipt_do_table() routine, we end up in 
__do_replace()
       0xFFFFFF9239243AE0, ->kvfree
       0xFFFFFF923A1969EC, ->xt_free_table_info+0x50
       0xFFFFFF923A2100E0, ->__do_replace+0x200

Prior to the original patch, this xt_free_table_info was under lock, so 
it seems that having this call under lock guarantees that the new 
table->private entry that contains the jumpstack is seen across all 
CPUs.

Good point. Perhaps the reason that moving this lock helps is because it 
prevents multiple writers from stepping on one another in such a way 
that the private entry is left in a bad state. Or this whole thing is a 
red herring and the problem is actually that xt_replace_table() is able 
to return prematurely and not all CPUs are finished with the old 
jumpstack by the time the old table info is freed.
