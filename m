Hi

I have a working prototype of a Jool wrapper for the nftables
framework. Details can be found here: [0]. Of course, it's not the
full integration you're hoping for (the rules simply send packets to a
Jool instance, in accordance to the current model), but it should keep
users happy while the transition happens.

However, I noticed that nft is not extensible (like iptables), so I
need to provide a custom nft build ([1][2]) instead of a plugin. I
don't think it's viable to expect my more casual users to build nft if
they need cooperation between Jool and nftables, thus I believe I need
to propose a merge of this early code into the nftables project.

Is this acceptable?
