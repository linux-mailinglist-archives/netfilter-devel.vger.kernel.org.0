Why not make the tests tolerate messages on stderr instead?

What do you mean with "the problem is now understood"?

Converting this to using octx->error_fp does not help?

How will those unit tests cover new statements added at a later time? We
don't have a registration process, are you planning to discover them
based on enum stmt_types or something like that?
