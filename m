Sure, its a question on definition as to what "flow start time" means.
See below for yet another proposal.

If I understood correctly its about using conntrack events + timestamp
extension to get (passive) RTT measurements.

I think cost depends on the clock source, hopefully most systems do not
have a too expensive one nowadays.

What about using skb_tstamp() first?  If skb already had rx tstamp
enabled, we'd get an even more accurate start time (packet arrival),
even before ct got allocated.
