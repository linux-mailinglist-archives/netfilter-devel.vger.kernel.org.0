OK.  I had hoped one could start with refactoring nf_conncount_count()
and then after that nf_conncount_count().

Right but AFAICS due to the missing 'template check' we pass all-zero
tuple_ptr if there is a template attached to the skb.
Not catastrophic but its not correct either.

I had hoped it was possible so s/tuple, zone/sk_buff/ in the
arguments and then handle that internally (first in count_tree and then
later in a converted nf_conncount_count(), i.e. push the sk_buff -> ct
handling down in followup patches.

OK, but the problem is that you need to know when you need to put the
reference and when you don't have to.

Task is:
given skb, return a
'ct' that is not a template
... but if its a template we need the zone to make a lookup ourselves
... and we have to bump (and put) refcount when we do that lookup
ourselves.

Maybe you could try adding a new api, e.g. call it
'nf_conncount_count_skb()' that then calls nf_conncount_count()
internally just to see how bad it looks?

If its not too bad, then all callers could be converted one after
another.

And then same with nf_conncount_add().

Just a suggestion, alternatively give your nf_conntrack_get_or_find()
a try, it would need a 'bool *refcounted' or similar arg and a
conditional 'if (refcounted) nf_ct_put(ct)' to be done by the callers.
