You would need to make something similar as
commit 960587285a56ec3cafb4d1e6b25c19eced4d0bce first.

Let me know if you need help.

No, it would not need to do this.

Basically all the .c code would have

#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)
ipv6-code here
#endif

where needed, so in case the kernel is built with CONFIG_IPV6=m|y, the
functionality is available.
