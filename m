I like the "table XXX is incompatible" because of how consequent it is.
But this is exactly orthogonal to your emphasis on "print as much as
possible", so not sure if we'll find a compromise. :)

What's your motivation to print parts of the rule which have been parsed
correctly? I assumed it is for debugging purposes.

# nft add table ip filter '{ chain FORWARD { \
	type filter hook forward priority filter; \
	ip saddr 10.1.2.3 meta cpu 3 counter accept; }; }'

# nft list ruleset 
table ip filter {
	chain FORWARD {
		type filter hook forward priority filter; policy accept;
		ip saddr 10.1.2.3 meta cpu 3 counter packets 0 bytes 0 accept
	}
}

# iptables-nft -S FORWARD
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -s 10.1.2.3/32 -j ACCEPT
# echo $?
0

Note: this is without any of your pending patches applied, I might even
miss pushed commits. I just did this using the current iptables-nft I
have around, but I don't recall any patches changing iptables' return
code if any of the nft_parse_* functions fail.

Cheers, Phil
