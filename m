Yep, looks like ERSPAN and VXLAN have to remain in place.

Right :-/

Looking at the nftables patches, I think some of what is done there
should be moved to libnftl, e.g. the $<obj>0->tunnel.type = TUNNEL_GENEVE;
thing.  I mean, it makes sense to track the type of the object but
wouldn't it make more sense to do this in libnftnl?

Thinking about it some more, I'm not sure if NFT_OBJECT_TUNNEL was a good idea.

We have:
  NFT_OBJECT_CT_HELPER
  NFT_OBJECT_CT_TIMEOUT
  NFT_OBJECT_CT_EXPECT

What about following that model, e.g.:

#define NFT_OBJECT_TUNNEL_GENEVE	11
#define NFT_OBJECT_TUNNEL_ERSPAN	12
...

?
Pablo, what do you think?  Maybe you tried this before and it wasn't
good either because of lots of duplication with common tunnel
attributes?

Back to the geneve option handling, I think it would be best to
expose all the fields in the struct via deticated setters/getters, i.e.
from

struct tunnel_geneve {
       struct list_head        list;
       uint16_t                geneve_class;
       uint8_t                 type;
       uint8_t                 data[NFTNL_TUNNEL_GENEVE_DATA_MAXLEN];
       uint32_t                data_len;
};

expose: geneve_class, type, and data.

This could be done by moving some of the nftables code you added to
libnftnl.

Instead of this in nftables:
  list_for_each_entry(geneve, &obj->tunnel.geneve_opts, list) {
        nftnl_obj_set_data(nlo, NFTNL_OBJ_TUNNEL_GENEVE_OPTS,
                           geneve, sizeof(struct tunnel_geneve));
        }
  }

do this (error handling omitted for brevity):

  list_for_each_entry(geneve, &obj->tunnel.geneve_opts, list) {
	struct nftnl_obj_tunnel_geneve_opts *geneve;

	geneve = nftnl_obj_tunnel_geneve_opts_alloc();

	nftnl_obj_tunnel_geneve_opts_set_u32(geneve, NFT_OBJECT_TUNNEL_GENEVE_OPT_CLASS, geneve->geneve_class);
	nftnl_obj_tunnel_geneve_opts_set_u32(geneve, NFT_OBJECT_TUNNEL_GENEVE_OPT_TYPE, geneve->geneve_type);
        nftnl_obj_tunnel_geneve_opts_set_data(geneve, NFT_OBJECT_TUNNEL_GENEVE_OPT_DATA,
					      geneve->data, geneve->data_len);

        nftnl_obj_tunnel_add_geneve_opts(nlo, geneve);

(nlo/nftnl_tunnel and nftnl_obj_tunnel_geneve_opts would be similar to
 nftnl_chain vs nftnl_rule).

The major downside is a lot of more API calls that need to be added to
libnftnl :-(

I don't see any other solutions at this time.
