So something like this:
table inet x {
	map dict {
		type string : verdict;
	}

	chain y {
		socket cgroupv2 level 4 vmap @dict
	}
}
and then systemd would add an entry like { 
"app-local\x2dfirefox\x2desr-01d5fcc2f9114e509e992cdaef3d84c3.scope" : 
accept } to the vmap "dict" when realizing the cgroup?
