Just run tests/monitor testsuite, echo testing simple.t will fail.
Alternatively, add a rule with anonymous set like so:
| # nft --echo add rule inet t c tcp dport '{ 22, 80 }'

With all respect, this wasn't obvious. There is no test case covering
it, commit message reads like it is an optimization (apart from the
subject containing 'fix').

Also, I tried to find a real solution (assuming that I'm merely supposed
to avoid pointless cache insertion) but ended up with code updating cache
for "no cache needed" case for anonymous sets and their elements. I
didn't revert out of laziness but because I deemed anything else not
feasible, after having tried two alternatives already.

Cheers, Phil
