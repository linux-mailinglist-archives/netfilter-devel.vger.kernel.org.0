\manonly is defined as

and as such looks kind-of frozen.

I have found that putting the right headers in the synopsis is very much a
manual task. I write a nonsense application that calls all the functions in a
man page and see what headers it takes for a clean compile. I see no way to
automate this process.

My contact with developers in the past has been bug reports with (rejected)
patches (the rejects are not surprising - they know their sysem way better than
I do). But the bugs have been fixed.

I have posted a couple of comments to Chris Miceli's blog titled "Integrating
Doxygen with Autotools". The posts talk about fixmanpages.sh and how it was
integrated into Makefile.am so are a bit old already.

Looking at the main website https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html, there is a
doxygen-projects mailing list that might be appropriate. I think one post
regarding Autotools integration and another post regarding man page enhancement
would be appropriate. How does that sound?

Cheers ... Duncan.
