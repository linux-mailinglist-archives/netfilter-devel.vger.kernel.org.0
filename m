I see. This makes sense to me as RHEL 7 does not include the range
check, while RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 both includes it.

The reason why any number beyond 31 results in a lower number is to be
searched in gcc implementation. IIRC shifting an int by more than 31 or
less than 0 results in an undefined behaviour, according to the C
standard.
