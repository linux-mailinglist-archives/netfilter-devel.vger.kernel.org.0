Hello! This is v4 RFC patch dedicated to socket protocols restriction.

It is based on the landlock's mic-next branch on top of Linux 6.16-rc2
kernel version.

Objective
=========
Extend Landlock with a mechanism to restrict any set of protocols in
a sandboxed process.

Closes: https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/6

Motivation
==========
Landlock implements the `LANDLOCK_RULE_NET_PORT` rule type, which provides
fine-grained control of actions for a specific protocol. Any action or
protocol that is not supported by this rule can not be controlled. As a
result, protocols for which fine-grained control is not supported can be
used in a sandboxed system and lead to vulnerabilities or unexpected
behavior.

Controlling the protocols used will allow to use only those that are
necessary for the system and/or which have fine-grained Landlock control
through others types of rules (e.g. TCP bind/connect control with
`LANDLOCK_RULE_NET_PORT`, UNIX bind control with
`LANDLOCK_RULE_PATH_BENEATH`).

Consider following examples:
* Server may want to use only TCP sockets for which there is fine-grained
  control of bind(2) and connect(2) actions [1].
* System that does not need a network or that may want to disable network
  for security reasons (e.g. [2]) can achieve this by restricting the use
  of all possible protocols.

Implementation
==============
This patchset adds control over the protocols used by implementing a
restriction of socket creation. This is possible thanks to the new type
of rule - `LANDLOCK_RULE_SOCKET`, that allows to restrict actions on
sockets, and a new access right - `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE`, that
corresponds to user space sockets creation. The key in this rule
corresponds to communication protocol signature from socket(2) syscall.

The right to create a socket is checked in the LSM hook which is called
in the __sock_create method. The following user space operations are
subject to this check: socket(2), socketpair(2), io_uring(7).

`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE` does not restrict socket creation
performed by accept(2), because created socket is used for messaging
between already existing endpoints.

Design discussion
===================
1. Should `SCTP_SOCKOPT_PEELOFF` and socketpair(2) be restricted?

SCTP socket can be connected to a multiple endpoints (one-to-many
relation). Calling setsockopt(2) on such socket with option
`SCTP_SOCKOPT_PEELOFF` detaches one of existing connections to a separate
UDP socket. This detach is currently restrictable.

Same applies for the socketpair(2) syscall. It was noted that denying
usage of socketpair(2) in sandboxed environment may be not meaninful [1].

Currently both operations use general socket interface to create sockets.
Therefore it's not possible to distinguish between socket(2) and those
operations inside security_socket_create LSM hook which is currently
used for protocols restriction. Providing such separation may require
changes in socket layer (eg. in __sock_create) interface which may not be
acceptable.

Code coverage
=============
Code coverage(gcov) report with the launch of all the landlock selftests:
* security/landlock:
lines......: 94.0% (1200 of 1276 lines)
functions..: 95.0% (134 of 141 functions)

* security/landlock/socket.c:
lines......: 100.0% (56 of 56 lines)
functions..: 100.0% (5 of 5 functions)

Currently landlock-test-tools fails on mini.kernel_socket test due to lack
of SMC protocol support.

General changes v3->v4
======================
* Implementation
  * Adds protocol field to landlock_socket_attr.
  * Adds protocol masks support via wildcards values in
    landlock_socket_attr.
  * Changes LSM hook used from socket_post_create to socket_create.
  * Changes protocol ranges acceptable by socket rules.
  * Adds audit support.
  * Changes ABI version to 8.
* Tests
  * Adds 5 new tests:
    * mini.rule_with_wildcard, protocol_wildcard.access,
      mini.ruleset_with_wildcards_overlap:
      verify rulesets containing rules with wildcard values.
    * tcp_protocol.alias_restriction: verify that Landlock doesn't
      perform protocol mappings.
    * audit.socket_create: tests audit denial logging.
  * Squashes tests corresponding to Landlock rule adding to a single commit.
* Documentation
  * Refactors Documentation/userspace-api/landlock.rst.
* Commits
  * Rebases on mic-next.
  * Refactors commits.
