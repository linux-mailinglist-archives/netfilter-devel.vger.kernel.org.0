I'll submit a patch then.

Meters are always anonymous afaiu, they are bound to the rule that
creates them.  Delete the rule -- meter is gone.

See
commit 24a912eea21f9d18909c53a865cf623839616281
parser_bison: dismiss anonymous meters

nft frontend only allows to create meter with a name.

I guess thats one way to put it.

Do you mean NFT_SET_EVAL?
If so, NFT_SET_EVAL is handled by nft_dynset.c (this is what gets used
when you use the 'meter' syntax).

Ok.  We can drop the checks once that is done.
