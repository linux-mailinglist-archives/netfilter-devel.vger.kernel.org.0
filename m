I see... Thank you. You saved me hours of work figuring this out.

So, for the TIME case we just swap left and right, and for the DAY case,
just add (tz_minuteswest * 60) to the seconds before breaking it into 
day/mon/year?

And what does tz_dsttime do? gettimeofday(2) man says it is there for 
historical reasons and should be ignored on Linux. But I don't know what 
is it for in the kernel.
