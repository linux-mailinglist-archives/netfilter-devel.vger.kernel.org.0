I think what happened here is that I came across this problem while
working on using payload expressions to set CT and packet marks, and in
that specific case stopping the double-evaluation in expr_evaluate_unary
fixed it.  However, when I looked for another example that was allowed
by the current grammar to put into the commit message, the one I found
was caused by stmt_evaluate_payload instead, but on the assumption that
the cause was the same, I didn't actually verify it.  Whoops.

Thanks for the analysis, Pablo.  I'll get started.
