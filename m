Its possible to defer the flush to until after we've reached the
point of no return.

But I was worried about delete/add from datapath, since it can
happen in parallel.

Also, I think for:
flush set x + delelem x y

You get an error, as the flush marks the element as invalid in
the new generation. Can we handle this with a flag
in nft_set, that disallows all del elem operations on
the set after a flush was seen?

And, is that safe from a backwards-compat point of view?
I tought the answer was: no.
Maybe we can turn delsetelem after flush into a no-op
in case the element existed.  Not sure.

Which then means that we either can't do it, or
need to make sure that the "del elem x" is always
handled before the flush-set.

For maps it becomes even more problematic as we
would elide the deactivate step on chains.

And given walk isn't stable for rhashtable at the
moment, I don't think we can rely on "two walks" scheme.

Right now its fine because even if elements get inserted
during or after the delset operation has done the walk+deactivate,
those elements are not on the transaction list so we don't run into
trouble on abort and always undo only what the walk placed on the
transaction log.

Sure, it sounds tempting to pursue this.

I think thats fine.

Yes, but I am not sure it is doable without
breaking some existing behaviour.
