It is difficult, I also can't come up with a much better name.  In doubt, w=
e
could stick with what you already have, I think.

LANDLOCK_RULE_SOCKET_PROTO alludes to "protocol" and even though that is th=
e
general term, it can be confused with the third argument to socket(2), whic=
h is
also called "protocol" and is rarely used.

Micka=C3=ABl, do you have any opinions on the naming of this?

Sounds good.  (Although I would not give "passing socket FDs to/from the
process" as an example, as long as it's not supported yet.)

Two brief side discussions:

* What are the scenarios where that creation request comes from kernel spac=
e?
  If this is used under the hood for network-backed file systems like NFS, =
can
  this result in surprising interactions when the program tries to access t=
he
  file system?

* To be clear, I think it would be useful to support the scenario above, wh=
ere
  accept() continues to work. - It would make it easy to create sandboxed s=
erver
  processes and they could still accept connections, but do no other networ=
king.

But to bring it back to my original remark, and to unblock progress:

I think for this patch set (focused on userspace-requested socket creation)=
, it
would be enough to clarify in the documentation which operations are affect=
ed by
the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE right.

That seems like a reasonable idea.  Would you like to file an issue on the
Landlock bugtracker about it?

Hm, OK.  I think that is debatable, but these are all things that are
implementation details and can be changed later if needed.  Sounds good to =
me if
we fix the undefined behaviour in the key calculation.

                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Is the wording "unsupported socket family" misleading here?

(a) It is technically a "protocol family" and a "socket type", according to
    socket(2). (BTW, the exact delineation between a "protocol family" and =
an
    "address family" is not clear to me.)

(b) "unsupported" in the context of protocol families may mean that the ker=
nel
    does not know how to speak that protocol, which is slightly different t=
han
    saying that it's outside of the [0, AF_MAX) range.  If we wanted to che=
ck
    for the protocol family being "supported", we should also probably retu=
rn
    -EAFNOSUPPORT, similar to what we already return when adding a "port" r=
ule
    with the wrong protocol [1]?

    [1] https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#extending-a-rul=
eset

I suspect that -EINVAL is slightly more correct here, because this is not a=
bout
the protocols that the kernel supports, but only about the range.  If we wa=
nted
to return errors about the protocol that the kernel supports, I realized th=
at
we'd probably also have to check whether the *combination* of family and ty=
pe
makes sense.  In my understanding, the equivalent errors for type and proto=
col,
ESOCKTNOSUPPORT and EPROTONOSUPPORT, only get returned based on whether the=
y
make sense together with the other values.

Thinking about it again, from a Landlock safety perspective, I believe it i=
s
safe to keep the checks as they are and to check for the two values to be i=
n the
ranges [0, AF_MAX) and [0, SOCK_MAX).

Even if we permit the rule to be added for an invalid socket type, there do=
es
not seem to be any harm in that, as these sockets can't be created anyway.
Also, given the semantics of these errors in socket(2), where also the
*combinations* of the values are checked, it seems overly complicated to ch=
eck
all these combinations.  I think it would be fine to keep as is, I was most=
ly
wondering whether you had done any deeper analysis?

It might be worth spelling out in the struct documentation that the values =
which
fulfil 0 <=3D family < AF_MAX and 0 <=3D type < SOCK_MAX are considered val=
id.  Does
that sound reasonable?

P.S., it seems that the security/apparmor/Makefile is turning the "#define"=
s
into C code with lookup tables, but it seems that this is only used for
human-readable audit-logging, not for validating the policies.
