Could you store something like a ebt_among_flags field in nft_xt_ct
object that the among match can use to check for the dependencies via
flags?

Probably good if we make these public through libnftnl. Just like we
made for udata definitions.

Not my intention that you update kernel. I was just wondering if a
NFT_LOOKUP_SET_PTR that becomes an alias of NFT_LOOKUP_SET_ID (but
that takes the set pointer as input) would make things easier for you.
Also, this could use it to fetch the set via nftnl_expr_get() once
attached, so you don't need to make cache lookups. Still the cache
lookup would be needed anyway for the netlink dump path though, so not
sure if this would really simplify things there.
