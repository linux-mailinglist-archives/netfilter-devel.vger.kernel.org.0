You mean the counters are still updated whenever the element is matched in 
the set and then one could check how many bytes were sent over the 
threshold just by listing the set elements.

Yes, you are right. Sometimes I think I'm far from the best at writing 
documentation... So I'm going to update the manpage with your sentence.

Again, yes, that's what would happen.

Those could really be useful if the counters could be decremented. 
Otherwise I think the counter matching in the sets is not as useful as it 
seems to be.

Yes, but now I don't really like the name itself: --force-update-counters
or something like that would be more clear.

The no update counter flag was introduced to handle when one needs to 
match in the same set multiple times, i.e. there are multiple rules with 
the same set. Like you need to match in the raw/mangle/filter tables as 
well. Unfortunately I can't recall the usercase.
