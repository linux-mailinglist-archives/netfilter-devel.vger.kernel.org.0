(This made me read up on Stackexchange about exact rules for present
perfect, only to find it is not neatly delineated.) IMO better to
just use present. They (still) support pkg-config.

"had included", as I don't see that m4 file anymore on my (mariadb) systems.
(There are a few mysql-related m4 files in autoconf-archive,
but that's not the same package as mysql/mariadb, I suppose.)

One caveat of m4 macros is that they may be left unexpanded if not found,
and it is up to the tarball producer to ensure the m4 macro is expanded.
Over the years, I built the opinion that this is not always a nice experience
to have.

I would do away with _MYSQL_CONFIG and just attempt to run `mysql_config` out
the blue. sh failing to execute mysql_config, or a compiler failing to find
mysql.h as part of AC_CHECK_HEADER is a nicer experience than _MYSQL_CONFIG
being left accidentally unexpanded.
