There is a generation number which gets bumped for each ruleset
update which is currently global.

Would having such generation ID per table help or you need more
flexibility in what needs to be stored in the userdata area?

We have these back-to-back update everywhere. The original idea was to
allow for robots to place all commands in a batch and send it to the
kernel, if the robot adds objects and then, while the same batch is
being collected, another update on such object happens, including one
that cancels the object that was just added, this is accepted since
this nonsense is valid according to the transactional model.

In this transactional model, batch processing also continues on
errors, rather than stopping on the first error, error unwinding is
special in that sense because objects remain in place and are just
marked are deleted. This allows for getting all errors to userspace at
once.

It is harder than classic netdev interfaces in the kernel.

Florian has concerns on this transactional model as too hard because
of the recent bug reports. If the direction is to tigthen this, then
I think all should be revised, not just reject this userdata update
while everything else still allows for back-to-back updates.

This is of course not related to your patch.

I am not saying it is not worth, and I am trying to understand your
requirements in case there is a chance to provide an alternative path
to using _USERDATA for this.

Thanks for explaining.
