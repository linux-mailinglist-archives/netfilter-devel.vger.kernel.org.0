Much of my testing was omitted from the commit message.  8192 was
chosen as to what seemed significantly above normal usage; I was way
off.  What I did observe was that machines (both big and small) start
to act up around 16M.  Would it ease minds to simply increase this to
something like 4M or 8M?  This would cover the largest case you have
but keep us below the dangerous threshold.  The tunable was in the
event someone had an extreme use case we didn't think of, or if they
wanted to be extra cautious.

I believe I was initing at a different location that required this,
and did not back this out.  I will remove.

I may be misunderstanding how limiting control to (only) non-init-*
namespaces would help. It certainly would keep a namespace from taking
the whole system down, but it would leave the original problem of
being able to create the deadly jump configuration purely in the
init-net.  Maybe protecting from a namespace is more fruitful than an
operator making mistakes (the initial revisions intent).

I had not considered one could spread the problem across multiple
tables (even if you can't jump between them).  This is a good insight,
and I will account for this.

Glad to hear, and I would like to try for a rev2, if my
question/clarifications make sense.

Thanks again!
