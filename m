Why not shorten it to "accept/drop/reject immediately terminate ..."

Ok.

Yes, this is because of netfilter verdicts vs. nftables verdicts.

accept/drop are both, continue, goto, return the latter.

This is because netfilter core has no idea what a ruleset is;
nftables "plugs" into the netfilter core.

The nf_tables base hooks interpret the user policy and then
issue either NF_ACCEPT, NF_DROP, NF_QUEUE or NF_STOLEN.

(the "core" verdicts).  But I agree that this is an implementation
detail that is irrelevant to the man page and that continue, goto, etc.
should be called verdicts too.

What about "terminal statements"?
This is already used in the man page in several places.

No.

net/bridge/netfilter/nft_reject_bridge.c:       regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/ipv4/netfilter/nft_reject_ipv4.c:   regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/ipv6/netfilter/nft_reject_ipv6.c:   regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/netfilter/nft_reject_inet.c:        regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/netfilter/nft_reject_netdev.c:      regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;

These are "obvious", reject is a fancier drop.

net/netfilter/nft_compat.c:             regs->verdict.code = NF_ACCEPT;
net/netfilter/nft_compat.c:             regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;

irrelevant for nftables

net/netfilter/nft_connlimit.c:          regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;

Error handling only

net/netfilter/nft_ct.c:                 regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/netfilter/nft_ct.c:         regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/netfilter/nft_exthdr.c:     regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/netfilter/nft_fib_inet.c:   regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;

Same, only errors

net/netfilter/nft_fwd_netdev.c: regs->verdict.code = NF_STOLEN;

Terminal (packet is redirected)

net/netfilter/nft_synproxy.c:                   regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/netfilter/nft_synproxy.c:                   regs->verdict.code = NF_STOLEN;
net/netfilter/nft_synproxy.c:           regs->verdict.code = NF_DROP;
net/netfilter/nft_synproxy.c:           regs->verdict.code = NF_STOLEN;

Also terminal, 3whs packets are dropped resp. stolen
for further processing.

That seems fine.

Yes, I think an example would be prudent, it is probably simpler
to unstand rather than describing the mechanism.

Yes.

Yes, you can also look into man iptables, --jump and --goto work the
same way in nftables.

Yes, rules in "regularB" are evaluated as if they would reside in
regularA, it resumes in the base chain.

Yes.

Yes, I think examples are best here.
