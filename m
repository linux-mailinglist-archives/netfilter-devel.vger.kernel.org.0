Phil, kernel was crashing after your patch, this was resulting in a
kernel panic when running tests here. I had to revert your patches
locally to keep running tests.

Please, just send an incremental fix to adjust the idx, revert will
leave things in worse state.

Audit does not show chains either, which is not very useful to locate
what where exactly the rules have been reset, but that can probably
discussed in net-next. Richard provided a way to extend this if audit
maintainer find it useful too.

Thanks.
