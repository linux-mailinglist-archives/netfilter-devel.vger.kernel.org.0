I think there is a way to achieve this with nft 0.9.6 ?

    datatype: add frag-needed (ipv4) to reject options

    This enables to send icmp frag-needed messages using reject target.

    I have a bridge with connects an gretap tunnel with some ethernet lan.
    On the gretap device I use ignore-df to avoid packets being lost without
    icmp reject to the sender of the bridged packet.

    Still I want to avoid packet fragmentation with the gretap packets.
    So I though about adding an nftables rule like this:

    nft insert rule bridge filter FORWARD \
      ip protocol tcp \
      ip length > 1400 \
      ip frag-off & 0x4000 != 0 \
      reject with icmp type frag-needed

    This would reject all tcp packets with ip dont-fragment bit set that are
    bigger than some threshold (here 1400 bytes). The sender would then receive
    ICMP unreachable - fragmentation needed and reduce its packet size (as
    defined with PMTU).
