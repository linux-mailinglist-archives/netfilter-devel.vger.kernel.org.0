The const here tells us that this string is set once and it gets never
updated again, which provides useful information when reading the
code IMO.

I interpret from Phil's words that it would be better to consolidate
this to have one single free call, in that direction, I agree.

/* Just free(), but casts to a (void*). This is for places where
 * we have a const pointer that we know we want to free. We could just

#define free_const(ptr) free((void *)(ptr))

I like this macro.

Maybe turn it into:

        nft_free(ptr)

and we use it everywhere?

BTW, nitpick, netdev comment style is preferred:

/* Just free(), but casts to a (void*). This is for places where
 * we have a const pointer that we know we want to free. We could just
 * do the (void*) cast, but free_const() makes it clear that this is

Thanks!
