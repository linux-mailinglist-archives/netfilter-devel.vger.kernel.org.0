This is what iptables-extensions(8) says:

IMPORTANT:  when  being  used in the INPUT chain, the cgroup matcher is currently only of limited functionality, meaning it will only match on packets that are processed for local sockets through early socket demuxing. Therefore, general usage on the INPUT chain is not advised unless the implications
are well understood.

For nftables, this is true for all meta types that use skb->sk internally,
such as skuid, skgid, cgroup, ...

sysctl.
net.ipv4.ip_early_demux = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_early_demux = 1
net.ipv4.udp_early_demux = 1

This is a performance optimization, tcp edemux only works for
sockets in established state, udp demux has restrictions as well.

So, no guarantee that this will set the socket reliably, hence the
paragraph in the iptables-extensions manpage.
