I think these functions support /etc/nsswitch.conf, so feeding them
names is not necessarily only a local lookup. But anyway, this doesn't
quite matter: /etc/nsswitch.conf is in control of the user, just as is
the input fed into run_cmd_from_*(). So for the sake of the discussion
here, it doesn't make a difference.

Yes, I believe the various name to number lookups are the only potential
blockers.

Did you find time for it already?
