I'm afraid if the chain remains in place with no device it won't be
any better once the system boots up again, because chains cannot
updated in old kernels.

I think chain updates go hand in hand with your proposed approach to
leave the basechain in place.

I am still exploring how ugly this fix looks, you will see get to know.
