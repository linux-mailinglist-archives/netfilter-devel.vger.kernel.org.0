Because this would be followed up by:

| Subject: Unable to create a table called "trace"

Jokes aside:

I think Pablo didn't like the obvious consequence of having to quote
*all* string types which are user-defined in output. He played with
keeping the quotes as part of the name, so they are sent to kernel and
in listing they would automatically appear quoted. I don't quite
remember why this was problematic, though.

In general, shells eating the quotes is problematic and users may not be
aware of it. This includes scripts that mangle ruleset dumps by
accident, etc. (Not sure if it is really a problem as we quote some
strings already).

Using JSON, there are no such limits, BTW. I really wonder if there's
really no fix for bison parser to make it "context aware".

Cheers, Phil
