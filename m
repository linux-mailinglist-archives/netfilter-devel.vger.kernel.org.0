I have been taking a look to the shell tests and we already have some
tests that cover these cases "tests/shell/testcases/chains/0001jumps_0",
"tests/shell/testcases/nft-f/0018jump_variable_0",
"tests/shell/testcases/nft-f/0019jump_variable_1",
"tests/shell/testcases/nft-f/0020jump_variable_1".

Also I have tested Pablo's v2 patch and it works fine for me.

I would like to know how could I prevent this kind of situations in the
future. Is there a way to automatically test your patch with other
relevant kernel versions?

Thanks! :-)
