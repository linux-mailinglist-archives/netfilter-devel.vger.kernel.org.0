+OVERALL EVALUATION OF THE RULESET
+---------------------------------
+This is a summary of how the ruleset is evaluated.
+
+* Even if a packet is accepted by the ruleset it may
+  still get discarded by other means, for example Linux generally ignores
+  various ICMP types and there are sysctl options like
+  `net.ipv{4,6}.conf.*.forwarding` or `net.ipv4.conf.*.rp_filter`.
+* Tables are merely a concept of nftables to structure the ruleset.
+  They are not relevant to the evaluation of the ruleset.
+* Packets traverse the network stack and at various hooks (see
+  <<ADDRESS_FAMILIES>> above for lists of hooks per address family) they’re
+  evaluated by any base chains attached to these hooks.
+* Base chains may call regular chains (via *jump* and *goto*).
+  Evaluation continues in the called chain.  Regular chains can call
+  other regular chains.
+  Chains residing in a different table cannot be called.
+* For each hook, the attached base chains are evaluated in order of their
+  priorities.
+  Chains with lower priority values are evaluated before those with higher ones.
+  The order of chains with the same priority value is undefined.
+* An *accept* verdict (including an implict one via the base chain’s policy)
+  ends the evaluation of the current base chain.
+  It is not relevant if the *accept* verdict is issued in the base chain itself
+  or a regular chain called from the base chain.
+  The packet advances to the next base chain.
+  Thus a packet is ultimately accepted if and only if no (matching) rule or base
+  chain policy issues a *drop* verdict.
+  All this applies to verdict-like statements that imply *accept*,
+  for example the NAT statements.
+* A *drop* verdict (including an implict one via the base chain’s policy)
+  immediately ends the evaluation of the whole ruleset.
+  No further chains of any hook are consulted.
+  It is therefore not possible to have a *drop*
+  verdict changed to an *accept* in a later chain.
+  Thus, if any base chain uses drop as its policy, the same base chain (or a
+  regular chain directly or indirectly called by it) must accept a packet or
+  all traffic will be blocked.
+  This also applies to other terminal statements that imply *drop*,
+  for example *reject*.
+* Given the semantics of *accept*/*drop* and only with respect to the utlimate
+  decision of whether a packet is accepted or dropped, the ordering of the
+  various base chains per hook via their priorities matters only in so far, as
+  any of them modifies the packet or its meta data and that has an influence on
+  the verdicts issued by the chains – other than that, the ordering shouldn’t
+  matter (except for performance and other side effects).
+  It also means that short-circuiting the ultimate decision is only possible via
+  *drop* verdicts (respectively verdict-like statements that imply *drop*, for
+  example *reject*).
+* A *jump* verdict causes the current position to be stored in the call stack of
+  chains and evaluation to continue at the beginning of the called regular
+  chain.
+  Called chains must be from the same table and cannot be base chains.
+  When the end of the called chain is reached, an implicit *return* verdict is
+  issued.
+  Other verdicts (respectively verdict-like statements) are processed as
+  described above and below.
+* A *goto* verdict is equal to *jump* except that the current position is not
+  stored in the call stack of chains.
+* A *return* verdict ends the evaluation of the current chain, pops the most
+  recently added position from the call stack of chains and causes evaluation to
+  continue after that position.
+  When there’s no position to pop (which is the case when the current chain is
+  either the base chain or a regular chain that was reached solely via *goto*
+  verdicts) it ends the evaluation of the current base chain (and any regular
+  chains called from it) using the base chain’s policy as implicit verdict.
+* Examples for *jump*/*goto*/*return*:
+  * 'base' {*jump*}→ 'regular-1' {*jump*}→ 'regular-2'
+    At the end of 'regular-2' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'regular-1'.
+    At the end of 'regular-1' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'base'.
+  * 'base' {*jump*}→ 'regular-1' {*goto*}→ 'regular-2'
+    At the end of 'regular-2' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'base'.
+  * 'base' {*jump*}→ 'regular-1' {*jump*}→ 'regular-2' {*goto*}→ 'regular-3'
+    At the end of 'regular-3' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'regular-1'.
+    At the end of 'regular-1' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'base'.
+  * 'base' {*jump*}→ 'regular-1' {*goto*}→ 'regular-2' {*goto*}→ 'regular-3'
+    At the end of 'regular-3' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'base'.
+* Verdicts (that is: *accept*, *drop*, *jump*, *goto*, *return* and *continue*)
+  as well as statements that imply a verdict (like *reject* or the NAT
+  statements) also end the evaluation of any later statements in their
+  respective rules (respectively cause an error when loading such rules).
+  For example in `… counter accept` the `counter` statement is processed, but in
+  `… accept counter` it is not.
+  This does not apply to the `comment` statement, which is always evaluated.
