Hi Phil,

Thanks for the answer. That's a very good idea. Today I saw the example 
sources of nftables using nft_run_cmd_from_buffer and I was wondering 
perhaps if I can use this function somehow.
I will simplify my code a lot. It will not be necessary to build all 
code for my mini-firewall tool and I think the foot print will be reduced.

Thanks for the idea!

Cheers.
