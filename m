Nice, thanks a lot for following up on this.

There is still one more case we have to cover and we go:

$ sudo nft add rule x z ip saddr map { 1.1.1.1 : 22 } vmap { 22 : accept }
Error: No symbol type information
add rule x z ip saddr map { 1.1.1.1 : 22 } vmap { 22 : accept }
                                      ^^

The existing syntax does not give us a chance to specify the right
hand side datatype. For named sets, this is fine because the set
reference implicit gives us the datatype. This information is not
available on implicit sets.

I think we have to update the syntax to include this information. For
the named set case, this will allow us to validate that actually the
specified selector and the set datatype are matching. For the implicit
sets, this will give us the datatype for the right hand side.

Otherwise, I'm afraid we will have to deal with variable length
integer, which will make things more complicated. At this stage, I
would start with strict typing, later on we can probably relax this in
the future as we find a way to reasonable infer information. This
means that a more verbose syntax, but I think that is fine.
