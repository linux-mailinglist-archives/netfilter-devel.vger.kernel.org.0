Hah, yes, that's what I was also thinking about, but:

this step is also prone to the original issue, that is, the choice of
the first node to walk might also be affected by inactive elements.

Now, I _guess_ the way you implemented it (not checking if elements
are active in this step) should be correct in any case, because the
tree ordering is always correct, so any active element that might be
"hidden" should become part of the walk anyway.

But give me a couple of days to think about it and if there might be
other corner cases.

All these look safe (and correct) to me.

Thanks a lot. I'll get back to you in a bit.
