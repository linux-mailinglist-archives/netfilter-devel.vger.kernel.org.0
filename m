That's a simple way to fix it, yes, ie. hit EBUSY.

Note that no such EBUSY limitation exists so far in the transaction
semantics that I know [*]. We already discussed that robots might do
non-sensical stuff when creating a batches, and reporting EBUSY for
this add-del-add case might just break them.

This also removes the conditional hook registration, so hooks are
registered once at chain creation. This simplifies interaction with
the netfilter core at the cost of adding complexity to
nf_tables_commit_chain_prepare() path.

[*] Well, you might still hit EBUSY from a batch, but that happens if
the object is really in use, not because of the add-del-add sequence.
