Hmm, this is a valid point indeed. At least one can't depend on stored
genid to match the local cache's state which defeats its purpose.

Well, I understand your approach and it's a proper way to deal with the
situation, but I fear this means quite some effort. I imagine we either
extend the xtables-restore table delete logic to add and disable more
dependency commands based on kernel ruleset contents or add these
dependency commands when iterating over the command set and populating
the cache.

The thing is, we do this mostly just for xtables-restore --noflush
logic, which in turn is probably not used often but popular among "power
users" trying to speed up the bunch of iptables commands they have to
enter at once.

Maybe we could go with a simpler solution for now, which is to check
kernel genid again and drop the local cache if it differs from what's
stored. If it doesn't, the current cache is still up to date and we may
just fetch what's missing. Or does that leave room for a race condition?

Thanks, Phil
