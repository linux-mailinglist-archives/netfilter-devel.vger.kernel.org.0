I don't think having concatenated ranges not merge even if possible is a
problem. It's just a "nice feature" with some controversial aspects.

The bug I'm reporting is that Above 'add element' command passes two
elements to nftables but only the first one makes it into the set. If
overlapping elements are fine in pipapo, they should both be there. If
not (or otherwise unwanted), we better error out instead of silently
dropping the second one.

Cheers, Phil
