the problem is that in SRv6 a packet to be processed by a node with an 
SRv6 End Behavior does not follow the INPUT path and its processing is 
different from the UDP tunnel example that you have in mind (more info 
below)

Note that I'm referring to the SRv6 Behaviors as implemented in seg6_local.c

An example of consistent user policies in node T that can be installed
now and are broken by the patch is the following:
 
   ip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

   ip6tables -A INPUT \
          -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type neighbor-solicitation -j ACCEPT                 
   ip6tables -A INPUT \
          -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type neighbor-advertisement -j ACCEPT
                                                              
   ip6tables -A INPUT \
          -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type router-solicitation -j ACCEPT
   ip6tables -A INPUT \
          -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type router-advertisement -j ACCEPT

   ip6tables -A INPUT \
          -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
   ip6tables -A INPUT \
          -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-reply -j ACCEPT

   ip6tables -P INPUT DROP  

The IPv6 destination address fc01::2 (SRv6 SID) is configured as an SRv6 End
Behavior in node T. On node T we expect to receive an IPv6+SRH packet with
DA equals to fc01::2.
Please note that the fc01::2 is NOT a local address for the T node.

In node T only the following protocols are allowed in INPUT:

  icmpv6 RA, neigh adv/sol and echo request/reply

while all other protocols in INPUT are discarded.

with this consistent configuration, node T is able to correctly process and
forward packets with IPv6+SRH destination address fc01::2 because the INPUT
path is not taken when SRv6 implementation is processing an SRv6 End Behavior.

After the introduction of the patch, this correct behavior is broken.

If you want I can provide a diagram with the full description of this 
scenario and all the scripts to reproduce the issue.

Andrea
