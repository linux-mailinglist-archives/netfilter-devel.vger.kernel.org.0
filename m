Thanks, I agree that we will need runtime checking because control plane
is too complex due to stores becoming unreliable (NFT_BREAK
encountered) if we want to do this load suppression.

I get the impression that we're overthinking this, we really
should not bother too much with speeding up iptables-style linear
rulesets.

I'm only concerned with speeding up compact rulesets that use
sets/maps wherever possible.

I think for those getting rid of the memset() will help more
than eliding a couple of reloads.

Right.  I used rule level because its easy to do but as you say,
it prevents userspace from ever making a "clever" ruleset that
performs any sort of preload (without kernel update).

Lets wait for your test with runtime checking, so we have some data
on how much of a slowdown that gives.

But I'd like to see some proof that a *good* ruleset has many
redundant loads where such cross-rule load elimination can add a
benefit in the first place.  Else doing runtime validation makes no
sense.

What I can think of is to allow this patch in,
i.e. rule level enforcement, and then follow a approach similar to what
you already proposed earlier: A per-chain prefetch stage.

This would mean instead of

chain [ rule [ expr, expr, expr ]] [ rule [ expr , expr ]] ..

we'd have
chain prefetch [ expr, expr ] [ rule ... ]

The prefetch is limited to selected meta and payload operations.
Failure means entire chain is bypassed.

Any sort of jump invalidates the prefetch.

So, this patch would be later relaxed to pre-init
the "prefetch" registers as "initialised", so following is legal:

prefetch: reg3: meta l4roto, reg4: meta load iif
rule 1: reg2 := ip saddr, lookup(reg2 . reg3 .reg 4) accept
rule 2: reg3 == icmp accept ...  // no longer rejected as uninitialized
rule 3: reg4 == "eth*" jump ...
rule 4: reg3 == icmp accept ...  // fails --> prefetch lost
rule 4: reg2 := ip saddr ...  // fails --> prefetch overwritten

Yet another idea: Introduce internal shadow registers:
Prefetch to reg1, reg2, reg3 will auto-store those *also*
to *pfr1*, *pfr2, and so on.

This would allow register content recovery after each jump:
reg1 = pfr1
reg2 = pfr2

and so on.

But again, I think this is the wrong approach and we should not
bother with load elimination or anything else that will complicate
the data path.

Combo match approach is good because it doesn't have that issue.
