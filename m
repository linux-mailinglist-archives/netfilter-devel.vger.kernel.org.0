Silly counter question: Does removing an include statement break UAPI? I
was once told source files shall directly include everything they need
and not depend on includes in headers, but "now you need this extra
header" is not far away from "now you need this other header", right?

Even sillier, is Alyssa's change legal regarding UAPI? All of glibc,
musl and uClibc seem fine, but in theory there might be a libc which has
odd things in netinet/if_ether.h.

BTW: I see only a single UAPI kernel header include from netinet space
(include/uapi/linux/mptcp.h) and it's for compat reasons (06e445f740c1
("mptcp: fix conflict with <netinet/in.h>")). Speaking of which, what if
we added:

| #ifndef __KERNEL__
| #include <netinet/if_ether.h>
| #endif

early into include/uapi/linux/if_ether.h? Aside from any header caches,
this should fix all of user space at once, no?

OK! I could probably write some git hooks to support my lossy memory.
