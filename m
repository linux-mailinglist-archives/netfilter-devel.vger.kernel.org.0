From nft based flowtable offload we already had a feature request to
bounce flows back to normal path periodially, this was because people
wanted to make sure that long-living flows get revalidated vs. current
netfilter ruleset and not the one that was active at flow offload time.

There was a patch for it, using a new sysctl, and author never came
back with an updated patch to handle this via the ruleset instead.
