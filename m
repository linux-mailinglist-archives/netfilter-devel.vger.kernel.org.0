Not sold yet. I'd like to hear Pablos opinion.

I was just curious.  No objections from me.

No, I would prefer simpler code, no need to special case this IMO.

Bitmask would allow to remove MATH_LEN, correct?

Users that want pure U8 increment can do 0xff000000
resp.  0x000000ff.

Same for U16.  So I'd say a mask would be better.

Yes, good question.  Due to netlink padding neither u8 nor u16 saves
space in the message encoding.  I'll leave it up to you, I don't see
2**32 math len making any sense.

Users don't interact with the expressions directly.
But I understand your point.

Pablo, whats your take?
