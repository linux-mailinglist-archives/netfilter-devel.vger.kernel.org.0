Correct.

Also correct. As stated in the description, xtables_pending_matches
should be grouped by name and family and within those groups ordered by
descending revision.

This piece of code confused me at first, too. I even wrote a quick test
to make sure the pointer stuff works as intended. :D

In fact, *pos can't be &xtables_pending_matches: pos is type 'struct
xtables_match **' (note the double pointer). pos is either
&xtables_pending_matches or the address of the right position's previous
element's 'next' pointer. Still confusing, but the for-loop is clear:

| for (pos = &xtables_pending_matches; *pos; pos = &(*pos)->next) {

So by doing '*pos = me', the 'next' pointer value is changed (or the
value of xtables_pending_matches.

This is in favor of the sorting algorithm: Inserting revision N+1 will
find revision N first in its group if revisions 0..N were inserted
before. So having extension revisions ordered ascending in their array
is optimal.
