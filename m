There are certifications which levy requirements on information flow control. 
The firewall can decide if information should flow or be blocked. Information 
flow decisions need to be auditable - which we have with the audit target. 
That then swings in requirements on the configuration of the information flow 
policy.

The requirements state a need to audit any management activity - meaning the 
creation, modification, and/or deletion of a "firewall ruleset". Because it 
talks constantly about a ruleset and then individual rules, I suspect only 1 
summary event is needed to say something happened, who did it, and the 
outcome. This would be in line with how selinux is treated: we have 1 summary 
event for loading/modifying/unloading selinux policy.

Hope this helps...

-Steve
