Quick summary:

We are currently discussing if it makes sense to add a new lock or
not. The commit_mutex stalls updates, but netlink dumps retrieves
listings in chunks, that is, one recvmsg() call from userspace (to
retrieve one list chunk) will grab the mutex then release it until the
next recvmsg() call is done. Between these two calls an update is
still possible. The question is if it is worth to stall an ongoing
listing or updates.

There is the NLM_F_EINTR mechanism in place that tells that an
interference has occured while keeping the listing lockless.

Unless I am missing anything, the goal is to fix two different
processes that are listing at the same time, that is, two processes
running a netlink dump at the same time that are resetting the
stateful expressions in the ruleset.
