Looks incomplete at best.

Looks like ipset is the only user, it sets it for kernel->user
dir.

I see ipset userspace even sets it on user -> kernel dir but
like you say, its not checked and BE encoding is assumed on
kernel side.

From a quick glance in ipset all Uxx types are always treated as
bigendian, which would mean things should not fall apart if ipset
stops announcing NLA_F_NET_BYTEORDER.  Not sure its worth risking
any breakage though.

I suspect that in practice, given both producer and consumer need
to agree of the meaning of type "12345" anyway its easier to just
agree on the byte ordering as well.

Was there a specific reason for the question?
