Yes, but we have to make do with the information we have (or we can
observe) and we have to trade this vs. occupancy of the conntrack table.

be0502a3f2e9 ("netfilter: conntrack: tcp: only close if RST matches
exact sequence")?

Yes, that is a side effect.  It was about preventing nat mapping from going
away because of RST packet coming from an unrelated previous connection
(Carrier-Grade NAT makes this more likely, unfortunately).

I don't know how to prevent it for RST flooding with known address/port
pairs.

I don't know how.

We can track TTL/NH.
We can track TCP timestamps.

But how would we use such extra information?
E.g. what I we observe:

ACK, TTL 32
ACK, TTL 31
ACK, TTL 30
ACK, TTL 29

... will we just refuse to update TTL?
If we reduce it, any attacker can shrink it to needed low value
to prevent later RST from reaching end host.

If we don't, connection could get stuck on legit route change?
What about malicious entities injecting FIN/SYN packets rather than RST?

If we have last ts.echo from remote side, we can make it harder, but
what do if RST doesn't carry timestamp?

Could be perfectly legal when machine lost state, e.g. power-cycled.
So we can't ignore such RSTs.

Yes, but I don't see how it helps.
Attacker can prepend data packet and we'd still move to close.

And I don't really want to change that because it helps to get rid
of stale connection with real/normal traffic.

I'm worried that adding cases where we do not act on RSTs will cause
conntrack table to fill up.
