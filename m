Your patch is needed because we have to deal with older kernels.

You assume revision 0 in case of EPERM. My patch provides better help
if the module is present since there is no need to assume revision 0.

Anyway, I think your approach is fine for the unpriviledged scenario
you describe. I just wanted to write here that there is room to extend
nfnetlink to support for unpriviledged requests.
