Yes, I think this is Option 3:

diff --git a/include/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.h b/include/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.h

 int __nf_ct_change_timeout(struct nf_conn *ct, u64 cta_timeout);

Note:

                WRITE_ONCE(ct->timeout, (u32)timeout);

is not required, because unconfirmed conntrack object is owned by the
packet (not yet in the hashes).


BTW, not related to this patch, but I would like to understand why
this __nf_ct_set_timeout() function is inline, but that is a different
issue.

Thanks for explaining, extending patch description would be good.

Unconfirmed conntrack is owned by the packet that refers to it, it is
not yet in the hashes. I don't see how concurrent access to the
timeout might occur.

Or are you referring to a different scenario that triggers the partial
state?

If you are observing a partial state, that is a different issue and I
think it deserves a separated patch with a description? Probably
including KCSAN splat if this is what you used to catch the partial
state.

Thanks!
