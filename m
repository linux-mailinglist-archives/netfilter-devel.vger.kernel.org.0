I am not sure we can use . tcp dport here, we might need a specific
datatype for offset.

It is very similar to my proposal, but using an explicit: payload +
math.

How are you going to express this in syntax? Maybe this:

   { 192.168.7.1 . 10.2.2.2 : 10.2.2.1 . +10000 }

or

   { 192.168.7.1 . 10.2.2.2 : 10.2.2.1 . -10000 }

so + or - tells this is an offset. Parser will need this notation, so
the evaluation step infers the map datatype from the element.

For explicit maps, we need the datatype to interpret that this is an
offset accordingly.

not sure I follow this modulus idea.

Your proposal is not a deal breaker to me, I think it will be more
work to explore than my proposal, but this delta datatype might be
useful in the future for generic delta add/sub in other payload / meta
fields.
