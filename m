From the ghak28 discussion, this list and order was selected due to
Steve's preference for the "kernel" record convention, so deviating from
this will create yet a new field list.  I'll defer to Steve on this.  It
also has to do with the searchability of fields if they are missing.

I do agree that some fields will be superfluous in the kernel case.
The most important field would be "subj", but then "pid" and "comm", I
would think.  Based on this contents of the "subj" field, I'd think that
"uid", "auid", "tty", "ses" and "exe" are not needed.

If we keep auid, I'd say keep ses, since they usually go together,
though they are separated by another field in this "kernel" record field
ordering.

I expect this orphan record to occur so infrequently that I don't think
bandwidth or space are a serious concern.
