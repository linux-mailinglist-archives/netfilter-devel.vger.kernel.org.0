From my perspective, the ipset holding elements and associated counters
is a separate entity from the set match in an iptables rule as in your
above example.

I didn't check the code, my intuitive understanding of how that set
match works is by element lookup which returns the element (if found)
with associated counters and the counter comparison happens afterwards.

With the above two assumptions in mind, the question how/when counters
should be updated is quite clear: Since there is no explicit "update
counter" action, the ipset is supposed to update counters whenever it
returns an element upon lookup.

iptables' recent match is a good example for a fully explicit interface,
but IMHO it is far from intuitive, either. :(

For quota or limit statements, that's the case. Otherwise they wouldn't
work:

| tcp dport 80 quota over 25MB drop

If the statement wouldn't count if 'over 25MB' condition wasn't true,
the condition could never become true.
