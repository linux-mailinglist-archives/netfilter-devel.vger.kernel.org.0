The driver should invoke the flowtable garbage collector let it clean
up the entries before the driver is unloaded.

This corner case is interesting.

Could you submit this patch without the lastused trick? Then, we can
revisit how the driver invokes the garbage collector to deal with the
cleanup?

All this model is based on the garbage collector being the one that is
responsible to cleaning up the flowtable. If there are multiple entry
points to add/remove entries to the flowtable, we'll end up with
complicated locking sooner or later.

Thanks.
