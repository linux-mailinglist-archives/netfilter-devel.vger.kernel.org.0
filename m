Sorry I should have been clear initially, I am trying to compile using nftables.

An unsigned long is 8B, which is why we want to use it instead of a "*", which
is a 128b capability in userspace, but is a standard 64b pointer in kernel space.
This is what I am trying to achieve; to maintain the layout between kernel and
userspace. The layout will be the same in kernel and userspace if unsigned long
is used since this is fixed size type to kernel and user.
Since these spaces in the structure i am modifying are reserved strictly for *kernel*
pointers, they should not be used by the userspace right? So I can safely have
userspace assume it is 64b and it will be okay since userspace will not try to
dereference what is stored within there?

I'm not sure I understand what you mean here. Although I have noticed the
compat functions in the code, I could not make sense of how/why and when
they are needed. Can you explain the use of this option? I guessed they were for
xtables/nftables compatibility, so they will not help or are not needed in
my instance?

Okay thanks that's good to know...

I guesss fixing up the --with-kernel option to use the specific headers from the
kernel repo (in my case my modified ones) would be a more sensible option where I
would solve my issue, but also be able to submit a patch that might be of use
to others?

Okay. Well I suppose if I have to do this for my own work and I can fix any
of these surprises this would be useful?

Many thanks,

Josh
