Agreed, no question there is a need for a lock from that path, the
discussion so far has been what type of lock, whether reset_spinlock
or commit_mutex.

reset_spinlock just makes sure that:

Cpu 1: nft list ruleset
Cpu 2: nft reset ruleset

do not show negative counters, as Phil reported with a test script.

commit_mutex just mitigates this issue, for reason see my reply below.

Yes, netlink dumps do not provide atomic listing semantics, that is
why there is the generation ID from userspace. I am trying to think of
a way to achieve this from the kernel but I did not come with any so
far.

From userspace, it should be possible to keep a generation ID per
object in the cache, so the cache becomes a collection of objects of
different generations, then when listing, just take the objects that
are still current. Or it should be possible to disambiguate this from
userspace with the u64 handle, ie. keep stale objects around and merge
them to new ones when fetching the counters.

But this is lots of work from userspace, and it might get more
complicated if more transactions happen while retrying (see test
script from Phil where transaction happens in an infinite loop).

This is the other open issue we have been discussing lately :)
