Is there a request for this? Or is the memory consumption a concern
on your end?

The void * is bad, and I dislike that this gets spread.
Could you add a "struct nft_set_elem_priv" that serves
as a proxy object?

All the priv elements would include it as first member,
so we can pass that around instead of void *?
