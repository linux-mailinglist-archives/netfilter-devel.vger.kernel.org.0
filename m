Automated regression test infrastructure is nice to have!

A few nitpick requests and one suggestion:

* Rename cttools-testing-framework.py to conntrackd-tests.py
* Move it to the tests/conntrackd/ folder
* Missing yaml dependency in python in my test machine

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cttools-testing-framework.py", line 36, in <module>
    import yaml
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'

this is installed from pip, right? Just a note in the commit message
is fine.

* Would it be possible to define the scenario in shell script files?
  For example, to define the "simple_stats" scenario, the YAML file
  looks like this:

- name: simple_stats
- script: shell/simple_stats.sh

The shell script takes "start" or "stop" as $1 to set up the scenario.
For developing more test, having the separated shell script might be
convenient.

This also allows to run scenario for development purpose away from the
automated regression infrastructure (although, you already thought
about this with the --start-scenario and --stop-scenario options, I
think those options are fine, I would not remove them).

Thanks !
