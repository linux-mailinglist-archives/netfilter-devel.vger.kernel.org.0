Sorry for being so dense.  I still don't follow your explanation.  You've
repeated the same paragraph that didn't make sense to me the first time.

What definition of "subject info" are you working with?  I had assumed
it was the set of fields that contain information that came from that
task's struct task_struct.  Some of those fields contain information
that isn't helpful.  Why not remove them all rather than keep one that
still contains no useful information?  Or is it a matter of keeping one
key field that contains no useful information that proves that the rest
is bogus?  Steve said that daemons leave no useful information in auid
as well, so I don't see how keeping this field helps us.  My
understanding is that the subj field's "...:kernel_t:..." is the key
here and that pid and comm give us a bit more of a clue that it is a
kernel thread.  Is that correct?  What use does including auid serve
here?

I suppose that the uid field is somewhat useful, since the kernel could
conceivably switch to a particular user to run a kernel thread.  Is that
even currently possible?
