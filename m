Yes, this is indeed somewhat of a downside of this approach: a kernel
which doesn't support the new attribute will use the compatible version
of the rule instead of the improved one. But apart from that, everything
just works.

Sorry. :(

No swap: The kernel will dump in NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS exactly what it
got in that attribute, same for the new one.

Yes, exactly. And old user space or nft will put the "new"
representation into NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS, not attach
NFTA_RULE_ACTUAL_EXPRS and thus the kernel will use the former in its
data path.

Fine with me! "ACTUAL" was suggested by Florian, probably to point out
that it's what should take precedence if present. In my understanding,
"ALT" means "as good as".

Thanks. Irrespective of the "crazy container people" mixing iptables
versions and variants like mad, I believe it will allow us to make more
drastic changes in future.

Cheers, Phil
