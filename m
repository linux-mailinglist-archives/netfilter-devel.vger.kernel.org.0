Hey.


Thanks for already merging the first patch of the series :-)

What I like about it, is that it avoids the slightly awkward "current
base chain (and any regular chains called from it)" construct...

What I'm neutral about: Strictly speaking, it does not mention whether
evaluation of any "parent" chains is also terminated.
You try to solve that by saying "Evaluation continues in the next base
chain"... and it is indeed kinda reasonable that all from the current
base chain are then stopped... but a weird system could in principle
continue with the next base chain, and eventually go back to the
previous.
(Just like originally I completely misunderstood how return works when
goto was involved).

What I like less about it, is that is misses this additional context of
"acceptance is only with respect to those chains".

Yes it can be deduced from the following sentence ("The packet may
however still be dropped by either")... and meanwhile, where I
(hopefully ;-) ) understand how it works, that seems enough, but for a
pure beginner it's IMO better to give such context and rather reinforce
things twice in different words.


What would you think about:
1st:
   Either:
Terminate the evaluation of the current chain as well as any chains
from which that was called and accept the packet with respect to the
base chain of these.
or:
Terminate the evaluation of the current chain as well as any chains in
the call stack and accept the packet with respect to the base chain of
these.

2nd and also replacing:
> The packet may however still be dropped by either another chain with a hi=
gher
> priority of the same hook or any chain of a later hook.

Evaluation continues in the next base chain (of higher or possibly
equal priority from the same hook or of any priority from a later
hook), if any.
This means the packet can still be dropped in that next base chain as
well as any regular chain (directly or indirectly) called from it.

Shamelessly stole and integrated that in my proposal above.

Uhm... I made it a perhaps bit extra verbose, mostly because we have
terms like "terminal statement/verdict", where not all of them are
really ultimately terminal.

What about the following compromise: O;-)

*drop*: Immediately drop the packet and terminate ruleset evaluation.
This means no further evaluation of any chains and it's thus - unlike
with  *accept* - not possible to again change the ultimate fate of the
packet in any later chain.

What I'd at least think would be nice to have is to re-iterate on that
conceptual difference between accept (may be overruled) and drop (is
ultimate).

The idea of that was a slight indication that these statements do:
<other things> + accept|drop.

Admittedly eventually isn't really perfect =E2=80=A6

=E2=80=A6 but since there's already this sentence, I think you're right an =
we
can just leave out the "eventually" without loosing too much.

Well first, whether you keep an internal verdict state or not... isn't
that again some implementation detail which here not really matters for
the user's understanding of how evaluation works?

I mean I'm open to change, but what I think should in one form or
another go in, is explicitly reinforcing that reject has the same
"power" like drop, i.e. it can render any further accepts (of other
base chains) moot.
That's what I mean with respect to "overruling" (i.e. and previous
accept).

You're proposal rather describes the side effects of *reject* which are
however IMO not really relevant with respect to overall ruleset
evaluation.

Like above... the idea here was again to reinforce that the statements
which internally issue an accept, have the same "weakness" as accept
itself, i.e. they're not ultimate and any later drop/reject/similar may
"overrule" them.



Any other ideas how include these two points? At least I personally
rather think that the actual side effect of "but will attempt to send a
error reply packet back to the sender" is rather not that interesting
with respect to the overall semantics of evaluation.


I think it makes no sense to spam the list with a v3 until I've got
your opinions on all the above points.... so I'm waiting for that and
the make a v3. :-)


Thanks and best wishes,
Chris.
