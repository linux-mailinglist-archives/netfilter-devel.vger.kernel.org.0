I got it, thanks for the clarification! Indeed, goal of this patch-fix
is to restrict such scenarios.

Thanks for the great explanation! We're on the same page.

Considering that binding to ephemeral ports can be done not only with
bind() or listen(), I think your approach is more correct.
Restricting any possible binding to ephemeral ports just using
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP wouldn't allow sandboxed processes
to deny listen() without pre-binding (which is quite unsafe) and
use connect() in the usuall way (without pre-binding).

Controlling ephemeral ports allocation for listen() can be done in the
same way as for LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP in the patch with
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_LISTEN_TCP access right implementation.

I'm only concerned about controlling the auto-binding for other
operations (such as connect() and sendto() for UDP). As I said, I think
this can also be useful: users will be able to control which processes
are allowed to use ephemeral ports from ip_local_port_range and which
are not, and they must assign ports for each operation explicitly. If
you agree that such control is reasonable, we'll probably  have to
consider some API changes, since such control is currently not possible.

We should clarify this before I send a patch with the
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_LISTEN_TCP implementation. WDYT?
