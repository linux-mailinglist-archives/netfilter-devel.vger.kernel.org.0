See:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20211025134329.1030333-1-pablo@netfilter.org/

to generalize the iftype.

I still have to post a patch to update libnftnl, then update all
dumps to refer to iftype instead of iiftype.

I'll apply these two patches if you are fine with their state.

I'd just would like to have this in the tree for easier testing,
I have to switch over several local branches here, one less makes it
slightly easier for me. And to include this in the next release.

Thanks.
