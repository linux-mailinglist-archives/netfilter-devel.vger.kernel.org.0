Hi Phil,

Thanks a lot for working on this, I have a few comments.

Patch 2: Could you provide an example scenario for this new patch?

Patch 3 looks good!

Regarding patches 4, 5 and 6. I think we can skip them if we follow
the approach described by [1], given there is only one single
cache_update() call after that patchset, we don't need to do the
"Restore local entries after cache update" logic.

Patch 10 looks fine. However, as said, I would like to avoid the patch
dependencies 4, 5 and 6, they are adding more cache_update() calls and
I think we should go in the opposite direction to end up with a more
simple approach.

Thanks!
