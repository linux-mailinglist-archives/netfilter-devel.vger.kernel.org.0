I think you're misinterpreting that commit regarding an attempt at
making diff binary configurable.

Sure, why not. For now it works just fine, apart from the duplicate
line which is merely a cosmetic issue.

Yes, I mentioned we don't expect $PATH contents to contain spaces.
Having such a thing would probably break more things than just
nftables testsuite. :)

This is no guaranteed functionality. There's no comment or anything
stating you could change the DIFF definition atop the script to
customize diff behaviour. So strictly speaking you're on your own if you
do that and a broken testsuite is not unexpected.

As said, the quotes are there to cover the expected 'which' output, no
more and no less. Supporting user-defined diff-command (or custom
options) is new functionality IMO. I'm totally fine with that and merely
want to point out we're not talking about fixing a bug here.
