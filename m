On the contrary. It does not complain about the declaration of T x[0],
but about the write beyond the end of an array of size 0 (literally).
Such past-end writes are Undefined Behavior by the standard, and tools
like cov-scan (based on llvm I believe) report it just the same.

That's why C99 probably had to come up with "T y[]"; the array is now
of unspecified size rather than size 0. cov-scan agrees.

Since GCC has retained "T x[0]" as an extension, it would be a gcc bug
to warn about its own extension in conjunction with memcpy.

Both T x[0] and T y[], in gcc, invoke the flexible scheme.

Both share the "embedding problem" - i.e. by using the flexible array,
you can accidentally access members of the surrounding struct.

gcc only complains about this when combining "T y[]" with C++ mode.
I find this to be an unusual choice and would suggest opening a bug.

The reason T x[0], when embedded, in C++, does not elicit a warning
is probably because it is already considered UB to access past-end-of-array
(see above); and I raise the hypothesis that the GNU extension of T x[0] is
actually only specified for C.

Anyway, gcc-10/C mode does not reject embedding (and a number of maintainers
have made it abundantly clear in the past they don't care if UAPI uses anti-C++
"features"). Nonreject example:

» cat x.c
struct a2 {
        int x;
        int z[];
};
struct m {
        struct a2 y;
        long q;
};
» gcc -Wall -std=c11 -c -w -v x.c
