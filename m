Dear Ryoga,
looking at your patch I noted several issues.
I start from the decap part but the same critical aspects are present also in
the encap one.

The main problem here concerns the use that has been made of the netfilter
HOOKs combined with the SRv6 processing logic.

In seg6_local_input, it is not absolutely guaranteed that the packet is
intended to be processed and delivered locally. In fact, depending on the given
configuration and behavior, the packet can either be i) processed and delivered
locally or ii) processed and forwarded to another node.

In seg6_local_input, depending on the given configuration and behavior, the
packet can either be i) processed and delivered locally or ii) processed and
forwarded to another node. On the other hand, your code assumes that the packet
is intended to be processed and delivered locally.


Calling the nfhook NFPROTO_IPV6 with NF_INET_LOCAL_IN can have several side
effects. I'll show you one below with an example:

suppose you have a transit SRv6 node (which we call T) configured with an SRv6
Behavior End (in other words, node T receives SRv6 traffic to be processed by
SRv6 End and forwarded to another node). Such node T is configured with
firewall rules on the INPUT CHAIN that prevent it from receiving traffic that
was *NOT* generated by the node itself (speaking of conntrack...). This
configuration can be enforced either through an explicit rule (i.e. XXX -j
DROP) or by setting the default INPUT CHAIN policy to DROP (as it would be done
in a traditional firewall configuration).

In this patch, what happens is that when an SRv6 packet passes through the
node, the call to the nfhook with NF_INET_LOCAL_IN triggers the call to the
firewall and the DROP policy on INPUT kicks in. As a result, the packet is
discarded. What makes the situation even worse is that using the nfhook in this
way breaks the SRv6 Behavior counter system (making that totally unusable).

Similar problems with the inappropriate use of the hook also exist in
action_end_dx4.

Another example where the normal processing flow is altered is in the
seg6_input() function (on the encap side). The seg6_input function should be
called in case of i) local processing and delivery or ii) local processing and
forwarding of the packet to another node. However, in this case a nfhook with
POST_ROUTING is called.

In turn, the seg6_input_core function calls the nfhook set with
NF_INET_LOCAL_OUT. Doing that side effects may be expected, because the natural
order of packet processing in netfilter, or more specifically in the SRv6
framework, has been changed.

There are also some minor issues, such as trying to follow the coding style of
the SRv6 Networking subsystem (this applies also to the Networking subsystem in
general). For example here:

+static int input_action_end_dx6_finish(struct net *net, struct sock *sk,
+                       struct sk_buff *skb)
+{
+    struct dst_entry *orig_dst = skb_dst(skb);
+    struct seg6_local_lwt *slwt = seg6_local_lwtunnel(orig_dst->lwtstate);
+    struct in6_addr *nhaddr = NULL;
+    [...]

The code should respect the Reverse Christmas tree, i.e:

    struct dst_entry *orig_dst = skb_dst(skb);
    struct in6_addr *nhaddr = NULL;
    struct seg6_local_lwt *slwt;

    slwt = seg6_local_lwtunnel(orig_dst->lwtstate);
    [...]


Ciao,
Andrea
