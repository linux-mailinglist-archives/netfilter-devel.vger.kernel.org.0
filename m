Thanks, this is nice.

I can see this function:

        static bool cmd_needs_full_cache(char *cmd)

the pre-parsing of the input to calculate the cache, which is good.

One thing: why do you need the conversion from \n to \0. The idea is
to read once from the file and keep it in a buffer, then pass it to
the original parsing function after this pre-parsing to calculate the
cache.

Please, add this to the remaining patches of this series.

Thanks.
