Ah, right. I forgot about "partial" rule execution again. Same thing
which broke expression reduction for us.

Maybe one could introduce a "chain optimizer" creating an initial
meta-rule which just populates registers with packet/meta data rules
may need. Not something I would want to rely upon regarding kernel info
leaks, though.
