+OVERALL EVALUATION OF THE RULESET
+---------------------------------
+This is a summary of how the ruleset is evaluated.
+
+* Even if a packet is accepted by the ruleset (and thus by netfilter), it may
+  still get discarded by other means, for example Linux generally ignores
+  various ICMP types and there are sysctl options like
+  `net.ipv{4,6}.conf.*.forwarding` or `net.ipv4.conf.*.rp_filter`.
+* Tables are merely a concept of nftables to structure the ruleset and not known
+  to netfilter itself.
+  They are thus irrelevant with respect to netfilter’s evaluation of the
+  ruleset.
+* Packets traverse the network stack and at various hooks (see
+  <<ADDRESS_FAMILIES>> above for lists of hooks per address family) they’re
+  evaluated by any base chains attached to these hooks.
+* Base chains may call regular chains and regular chains may call other regular
+  chains (via *jump* and *goto* verdicts), in which case evaluation continues in
+  the called chain.
+  Base chains themsevlves cannot be called and only chains of the same table can
+  be called.
+* For each hook, the attached chains are evaluated in order of their priorities.
+  Chains with lower priority values are evaluated before those with higher ones.
+  The order of chains with the same priority value is undefined.
+* An *accept* verdict (including an implict one via the base chain’s policy)
+  ends the evaluation of the current base chain (and any regular chains called
+  from that).
+  It accepts the packet only with respect to the current base chain. Any other
+  base chain (or regular chain called by such) with a higher priority of the
+  same hook as well as any other base chain (or regular chain called by such) of
+  any later hook may however still ultimately *drop* (which might also be done
+  via verdict-like statements that imply *drop*, like *reject*) the packet with
+  an according verdict (with consequences as described below for *drop*).
+  Thus and merely from netfilter’s point of view, a packet is only ultimately
+  accepted if none of the chains (regardless of their tables) that are attached
+  to any of the respectively relevant hooks issues a *drop* verdict (be it
+  explicitly or implicitly by policy or via a verdict-like statement that
+  implies *drop*, for example *reject*), which already means that there has to
+  be at least one *accept* verdict (be it explicitly or implicitly by policy).
+  All this applies analogously to verdict-like statements that imply *accept*,
+  for example the NAT statements.
+* A *drop* verdict (including an implict one via the base chain’s policy)
+  immediately ends the evaluation of the whole ruleset and ultimately drops the
+  packet.
+  Unlike with an *accept* verdict, no further chains of any hook and regardless
+  of their table get evaluated and it’s therefore not possible to have an *drop*
+  verdict overruled.
+  Thus, if any base chain uses drop as its policy, the same base chain (or any
+  regular chain directly or indirectly called by it) must accept a packet or it
+  is ensured to be ultimately dropped by it.
+  All this applies analogously to verdict-like statements that imply *drop*,
+  for example *reject*.
+* Given the semantics of *accept*/*drop* and only with respect to the utlimate
+  decision of whether a packet is accepted or dropped, the ordering of the
+  various base chains per hook via their priorities matters only in so far, as
+  any of them modifies the packet or its meta data and that has an influence on
+  the verdicts issued by the chains – other than that, the ordering shouldn’t
+  matter (except for performance and other side effects).
+  It also means that short-circuiting the ultimate decision is only possible via
+  *drop* verdicts (respectively verdict-like statements that imply *drop*, for
+  example *reject*).
+* A *jump* verdict causes the current position to be stored in the call stack of
+  chains and evaluation to continue at the beginning of the called regular
+  chain.
+  Called chains must be from the same table and cannot be base chains.
+  When the end of the called chain is reached, an implicit *return* verdict is
+  issued.
+  Other verdicts (respectively verdict-like statements) are processed as
+  described above and below.
+* A *goto* verdict is equal to *jump* except that the current position is not
+  stored in the call stack of chains.
+* A *return* verdict ends the evaluation of the current chain, pops the most
+  recently added position from the call stack of chains and causes evaluation to
+  continue after that position.
+  When there’s no position to pop (which is the case when the current chain is
+  either the base chain or a regular chain that was reached solely via *goto*
+  verdicts) it ends the evaluation of the current base chain (and any regular
+  chains called from it) using the base chain’s policy as implicit verdict.
+* Examples for *jump*/*goto*/*return*:
+  * 'base' {*jump*}→ 'regular-1' {*jump*}→ 'regular-2'
+    At the end of 'regular-2' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'regular-1'.
+    At the end of 'regular-1' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'base'.
+  * 'base' {*jump*}→ 'regular-1' {*goto*}→ 'regular-2'
+    At the end of 'regular-2' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'base'.
+  * 'base' {*jump*}→ 'regular-1' {*jump*}→ 'regular-2' {*goto*}→ 'regular-3'
+    At the end of 'regular-3' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'regular-1'.
+    At the end of 'regular-1' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'base'.
+  * 'base' {*jump*}→ 'regular-1' {*goto*}→ 'regular-2' {*goto*}→ 'regular-3'
+    At the end of 'regular-3' or when a *return* is issued in that, evaluation
+    continues after the *jump* position in 'base'.
+* Verdicts (that is: *accept*, *drop*, *jump*, *goto*, *return*, *continue* and
+  *queue*) as well as statements that imply a verdict (like *reject* or the NAT
+  statements) also end the evaluation of any later statements in their
+  respective rules (respectively cause an error when loading such rules).
+  For example in `… counter accept` the `counter` statement is processed, but in
+  `… accept counter` it is not.
+  This does not apply to the `comment` statement, which is always evaluated.
