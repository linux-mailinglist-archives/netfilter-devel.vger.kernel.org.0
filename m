Hmm.  Can you elaborate?  The sport is never randomized, unless either
1. User explicitly requested it via "random" flag passed to snat rule, or
2. the is an existing connection, using the *same* sport:saddr -> daddr:dport
   quadruple as the new request.

In 2), this new toggle prevents communication.  So I wonder why ...

... the rfc mandates this, especially given the fact that endpoints have
0 control on middlebox behaviour.

This flag will completely prevent communication in case another
middlebox does sport randomization, so I wonder why its needed -- I see
no advantages but I see a downside.

Can you elaborate? If we're the middlebox and we restarted, we have no
record of the "old" incarnation so there is no sport reallocation.

Hmm?  Not following.

1.2.3.4:12345 -> 5.6.7.8:42
1.2.3.4:12345 -> 5.6.7.8:43

... should work fine. Same for
1.2.3.4:12345 -> 5.6.7.8:42
1.2.3.4:12345 -> 5.6.7.9:42

Can you elaborate?  How is an existing assocation lost?
For example, what sequence of events is needed to result in loss of
an existing association?
