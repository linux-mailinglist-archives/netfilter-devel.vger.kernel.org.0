Hello Frank,

I'm not sure what exactly tripped me up (or is still confusing
me). I think it's mainly that the concepts of hooks (prerouting,
postrouting, etc.), chain types (filter, nat, etc.) and netfilter
hook priority was never really spelled out in a way that all the
pieces fit together (for me). The fact that the order of
priorities is not directly related to hooks made it worse (I
didn't realize that the priorities only order entries for a
single hook).

Thank you. That made it clearer for me.

Of course.

No. I was talking about the chain types:
https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Configuring_chains#Base_c=
hain_types

And I'm curious what's the difference in regard to netfilter
between these types. They are all added to the same netfilter
hook (e.g. prerouting can use filter, nat, etc. chains). Does
netfilter see any difference or is this just relevant to
nftables?

Regards
Simon
