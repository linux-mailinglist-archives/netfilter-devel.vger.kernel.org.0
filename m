No, its of no specific interest.  I just worded this poorly.
If the generation id increments, then something has been changed by the
batch, thats all.

The permission check is done early, in nfnetlink_rcv() (search for
EPERM), you would need to add an audit call there if thats relevant
for audit purposes.

Maybe the handle of the set that the element was added to.
Each set, rule, chain, ... has a kernel-assigned number that
serves as a unique identifier.

In that case, use the handle, which is a u64 with a unique value (for a
given table).

Ok.  Have a look at nf_tables_fill_gen_info() in that case, you probably
want to emit at least the pid and task info, unless audit doesn't add
that already anyway.

Ok.  Yes, that is available (rule->handle).
