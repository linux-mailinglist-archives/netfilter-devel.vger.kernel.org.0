The thing is, the Deprecated functions in libnetfilter_queue are much better
documented than the newer functions and that documentation refers to
libnfnetlink functions.

So I think that while the deprecated functions are documented, you should really
have documentation for the old library they use.

BTW, ldd of my app shows libnfnetlink.so although it doesn't use any deprecated
functions. Is that expected?
