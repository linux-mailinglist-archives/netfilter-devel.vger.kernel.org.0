If we follow that pattern then the indirection would need the
nft_trans_phase enum, the quota struct and also the tb[] as parameters
because in the preparation phase we always need the tb[] array.

Why is that better than annotating tb[] on the object? Sorry, I think
that I am missing something here. Thanks!
