Indeed, but depending on the flag's scope we may get by with just a
shell test case to cover the "accept with no matching interface"
behaviour.

I did not measure a significant slowdown even with a wildcard interface
spec matching 10k interfaces, neither for flowtable or chain creation or
chain deletion. The only impacted action is flowtable deletion, I
suspect nf_flowtable_by_dev_remove() to cause the slowdown.

I don't think we need a feature flag for this though, users may simply
not use wildcard interface specs to avoid it.

It's the only one I had in mind.

The two issues being typos and performance issues? If so, performance
should not be an issue (merely flowtable deletion slows down, but that
may be something we might optimize away). Typos are something I
personally wouldn't care about as I find it similar to mis-typing an IP
address or RHS to an iifname match. If transparency of behaviour is a
concern, I'd rather implement GETDEV message type and enable user space
to print the list of currently bound interfaces (though it's partially
redundant, 'nft list hooks' helps there although it does not show which
flowtable/chain "owns" the hook).

Cheers, Phil
