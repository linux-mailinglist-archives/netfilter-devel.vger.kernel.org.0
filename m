I have a little question to clarify before sending a next version. Are
we condisering order of network checks for error consistency?

For example, in the current_check_access_socket() we have following
order of checks for ipv4 connect(2) action:
(1) addrlen < sizeof(struct sockaddr_in) -> return -EINVAL
(2) sa_family != sk_family -> return -EINVAL

The ipv4 stack has a check for sock->state before (1) and (2), which can
return -EISCONN if the socket is already connected.

This results in the possiblity of two following scenarios:

Landlock enabled:
1. socket(ipv4) -> OK
2. connect(ipv4 address) -> OK
3. connect(ipv6 address) -> -EINVAL (sa_family != sk_family)

Landlock disabled:
1. socket(ipv4) -> OK
2. connect(ipv4 address) -> OK
3. connect(ipv6 address) -> -EISCONN (socket is already connected)

I have always considered the order of network checks as part of error
consistency, and I'd like to make sure that we're on the same page
before extending current patch with error inconsistency fixes.
