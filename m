Yes. I didn't consider the need for this kind of specification, given
that you can obtain the same result by simply adding two elements:
separate, partially overlapping elements can be inserted (which is, if I
recall correctly, not the case for rbtree).

If I recall correctly, we had a short discussion with Florian about
this, but I don't remember the conclusion.

However, I see the ugliness, and how this breaks probably legitimate
expectations. I guess we could call set_to_intervals() in this case,
that function might need some minor adjustments.

An alternative, and I'm not sure which one is the most desirable, would
be to refuse that kind of insertion.
