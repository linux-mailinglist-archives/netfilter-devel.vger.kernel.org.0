I know of no typographic basis that dates should _not_ be expressed
with the normal regular hyphen.

I also have to reject this. You are disabling linebreaking, which
just causes text to run off. It's complicated:

* In PostScript & PDF (`man -t -l iptables-extensions.8 >1.ps &&
  ps2pdf 1.ps`):
  text runs off the page and the rest just vanishes

* In HTML: it depends on additional style properties emitted into the
  HTML page by the; in any case, browsers won't wrap <pre> and let
  text equally run off when emitting to a printer. Emitting to a
  display can work (infinitely-sized page), but you have to scroll right.

* In terminals: it depends on the terminal's wrap setting. You can
  try this yourself: use Ctrl-A-R in GNU screen and type a really long
  command.

Number ranges should use an en dash. I fixed that now..
