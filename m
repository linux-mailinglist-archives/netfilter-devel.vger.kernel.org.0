Subject: [PATCH nf-next 1/3] netfilter: nf_nat: don't try nat source port reallocation for reverse dir clash

A conntrack entry can be inserted to the connection tracking table if there
is no existing entry with an identical tuple in either direction.

Example:
INITIATOR -> NAT/PAT -> RESPONDER

Initiator passes through NAT/PAT ("us") and SNAT is done (saddr rewrite).
Then, later, NAT/PAT machine itself also wants to connect to RESPONDER.

This will not work if the SNAT done earlier has same IP:PORT source pair.

Conntrack table has:
ORIGINAL: $IP_INITATOR:$SPORT -> $IP_RESPONDER:$DPORT
REPLY:    $IP_RESPONDER:$DPORT -> $IP_NAT:$SPORT

and new locally originating connection wants:
ORIGINAL: $IP_NAT:$SPORT -> $IP_RESPONDER:$DPORT
REPLY:    $IP_RESPONDER:$DPORT -> $IP_NAT:$SPORT

This is handled by the NAT engine which will do a source port reallocation
for the locally originating connection that is colliding with an existing
tuple by attempting a source port rewrite.

This is done even if this new connection attempt did not go through a
masquerade/snat rule.

There is a rare race condition with connection-less protocols like UDP,
where we do the port reallocation even though its not needed.

This happens when new packets from the same, pre-existing flow are received
in both directions at the exact same time on different CPUs after the
conntrack table was flushed (or conntrack becomes active for first time).

With strict ordering/single cpu, the first packet creates new ct entry and
second packet is resolved as established reply packet.

With parallel processing, both packets are picked up as new and both get
their own ct entry.

In this case, the 'reply' packet (picked up as ORIGINAL) can be mangled by
NAT engine because a port collision is detected.

This change isn't enough to prevent a packet drop later during
nf_conntrack_confirm(), the existing clash resolution strategy will not
detect such reverse clash case.  This is resolved by a followup patch.
