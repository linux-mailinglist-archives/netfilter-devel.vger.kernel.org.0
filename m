Hi,

I'm currently trying to fix for an issue in Kubernetes realm[1]:
Baseline is they are trying to restore a ruleset with ~700k lines and it
fails. Needless to say, legacy iptables handles it just fine.

Meanwhile I found out there's a limit of 1024 iovecs when submitting the
batch to kernel, and this is what they're hitting.

I can work around that limit by increasing each iovec (via
BATCH_PAGE_SIZE) but keeping pace with legacy seems ridiculous:

With a scripted binary-search I checked the maximum working number of
restore items of:

(1) User-defined chains
(2) rules with merely comment match present
(3) rules matching on saddr, daddr, iniface and outiface

Here's legacy compared to nft with different factors in BATCH_PAGE_SIZE:

legacy		32 (stock)	  64		   128          256
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1'636'799	1'602'202	- NC -		  - NC -       - NC -
1'220'159	  302'079	604'160		1'208'320      - NC -
3'532'040	  242'688	485'376		  971'776    1'944'576

At this point I stopped as the VM's 20GB RAM became the limit
(iptables-nft-restore being OOM-killed instead of just failing).

What would you suggest? Should I just change BATCH_PAGE_SIZE to make it
"large enough" or is there a better approach?

Cheers, Phil
