Does it mess with error reporting? If not, I don't see a downside of
doing it.

With regards to the problem at hand, it seems like a feature to escape
the actual problem. Please keep in mind that my patch's improvement from
~4min down to ~1min is pretty lousy given that v1.0.1 completed the same
task in 0.3s.

IMHO the whole overlap detection/auto merging should happen as commit
preparation and not per command.

Cheers, Phil
