Correct, but we also agreed to use bitmasks for "family" field as well:

I thought about unrolling bitmask into multiple entries in rbtree, and
came up with following possible issue:

Imagine that a user creates a rule that allows to create sockets of all
possible families and types (with protocol=0 for example):
{
	.allowed_access = LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE,
	.families = INT64_MAX, /* 64 set bits */
	.types = INT16_MAX, /* 16 set bits */
	.protocol = 0,
},

This will add 64 x 16 = 1024 entries to the rbtree. Currently, the
struct landlock_rule, which is used to store rules, weighs 40B. So, it
will be 40kB by a single rule. Even if we allow rules with only
"existing" families and types, it will be 46 x 7 = 322 entries and ~12kB
by a single rule.

I understand that this may be degenerate case and most common rule will
result in less then 8 (or 4) entries in rbtree, but I think API should
be as intuitive as possible. User can expect to see the same
memory usage regardless of the content of the rule.

I'm not really sure if this case is really an issue, so I'd be glad
to hear your opinion on it.

I also initially thought that it would be difficult to handle errors
when adding rule. But it seems that it's not gonna be an issue with
correctly implemented removal (this will result in additional method in
ruleset.c and small wrapper over rule structure that would not affect
ruleset domain implementation).

I think it'll be better to have a separate series for [2] if the socket
restriction can be implemented without rbtree refactoring.

It seems like it would be better to have a different structure for
non-ranged lookups if it results in less memory and lookup duration.
First, we need to check possible candidates for both cases.

I agree if you think that worst case presented above is not a big issue.
