I have applied the series apart from patch 2: The wrong XTOPT_MAND flag
is present since v1.4.11, if anyone actually depends on the behaviour,
they would have complained. So leaving things as they are is fine, and
instead one should go into another direction:

- Drop XTOPT_MAND and instead provide a better error message in
  x6_fcheck callback, pointing out that '-p icmp -m icmp' is equivalent
  to plain '-p icmp'.

- Same for '--icmp-type any'? In theory, it's pointless.

A nicer option would be to turn '-m icmp [--icmp-type any]' into a NOP.
Using '-p icmp' is mandatory anyway. There's no support for matches to
remove themselves, though. I guess this could be done by extending
xtables_option_mfcall().

Cheers, Phil
