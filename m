Does that work even work?
new table x
del table x
add rule to x // table was deleted?

Or are you talking about a new/del/new sequence?

If it works, ok/fine, but it seems ugly.

Yes, we can't do this in the --noflush case though.

Its for ipt-nft-restore, including --noflush.

It would be good though to also speed up 'iptables-nft -A' later on
by eliding cache completely.
