The ipset match cannot check the other parts of the iptables rule.

The question is that in the case of the ipset match, say

	-m set --match-set foo src --packets-lt N

should the ipset elemet counters be updated if the packet matched the set
or if the packet matched the set and the element counter values according 
to the condition as well? What constitutes a "match" in the ipset context 
and how does it refer to the counter updating?

Stefano believes that the former is the natural choice. In my mind the 
second one.

The patch in the ipset git tree makes possible to choose :-)

What is the case with nftables? Is the counter value updated if the 
counter match parts in a rule returns false?

Best regards,
Jozsef
