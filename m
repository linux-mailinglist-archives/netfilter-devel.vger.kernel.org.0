Can you explain?

My point about 'new' is that

 (a) there's a lot more 'new' than 'this'

 (b) without dealing with 'new', dealing with 'this' is pointless

So why bother? Without some kind of pre-processing phase to make our C
code palatable to a C++ parser, it will never work.

And if you _do_ have a pre-processing phase (which might be a #define,
but might also be a completely separate pass with some special tool),
converting 'this' in the kernel sources isn't useful anyway, because
you could just do it in the pre-processing phase instead.

See? THAT is why I'm harping on 'new'. Not because you sent me a patch
to deal with 'new', but because such a patch will never be accepted,
and without that patch the pain from 'this' seems entirely irrelevant.

What's your plan for 'new'? And why doesn't that plan then work for 'this'?
