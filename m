Indeed, implementing a new type of rule seems to be an optimal approach
for this.

I thought about something like that, yeah) Also, I tried to find out
if there are cases where port remains bound to the client socket after
the connection is completed. In this case, listen() can be called to a
socket with a port bound via connect() call. In the case of TCP, such
scenario is not possible, port is always deallocated in tcp_set_state()
method.

So, I don't see any realworld vulnerabilities, we can leave this case
until someone comes up with a real issue.

Agreed. Anyway, if someone finds any interesting cases with
auto-binding via sendto(), we can implement a new rule, as you suggested
for connect().

Thanks you for your research and ideas, Günther!
I'll prepare the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_LISTEN_TCP patchset for the review.
