What is the problem without unshare? Looking at your patch, it seems
possible to drop the handle attributes in json-sanitize-ruleset.sh.

Given the inherent importance of the handle value for ruleset
manipulations, I assume *any* application will need to be updated to
pass --handle (or the libnftables-equivalent) to remain functional.
