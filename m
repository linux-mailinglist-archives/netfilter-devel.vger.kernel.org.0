Lorenzo adds a kfunc that gets called from the xdp program
to do a lookup in the flowtable.

This patchset prepares for the kfunc by adding a function that
returns the flowtable based on net_device pointer.

The work queue for hw offload (or ndo ops) are not used.

If the xdp program can't handle it packet will be pushed up the stack,
i.e. nf ingress hook will handle it next.

I don't understand, you mean no integration at all?
