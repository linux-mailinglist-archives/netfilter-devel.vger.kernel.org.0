Oh, right. So a decision whether this is feasible and if, how it should
behave in detail, is urgent.

I wasn't sure if it's "required" to prevent it as well or not. This
patch was motivated by Pablo reporting users would not notice mis-typed
interface names anymore and asking for whether introducing a feature
flag for it was possible. So I went ahead to have something for a
discussion.

Actually, wildcards are not handled differently: If user specifies
"eth123", kernel errors if no "eth123" exists and accepts otherwise. If
user specifies "eth*", kernel errors if no interface with that prefix
exists and accepts otherwise.

I don't know where to go with this. If the flag should turn interface
specs name-based, its absence should fully restore the old behaviour (as
you kindly summarized below). If it's just about the typo, this patch
might be fine.

No, this patch has the kernel error also if it doesn't find a match for
the wildcard. It merely asserts that the hook's ops_list is non-empty
after nft_netdev_hook_alloc() (which did the search for matching
interfaces) returns.

Yes, that was the premise upon which I wrote the patch. I didn't intend
to make the flag toggle between the old interface hooks and the new
interface name hooks.

My statement above was probably a bit confusing: With non-persistent, I
meant for the flag to be recognized upon chain/flowtable creation but
not added to chain->flags or flowtable->data.flags.
