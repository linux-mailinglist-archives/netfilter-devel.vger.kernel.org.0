Mostly interoperability, I guess. Recent real-world scenario is host
firewall management from inside a container (please don't ask me why):
If the host uses legacy iptables (for legacy reasons ;) the top-notch
state of the art container has to do so as well or hell freezes over.

Apart from that, I can imagine there are users depending on one of the
few missing features like e.g. broute table in ebtables.

Sadly, we can't claim the same for nft - its caching strategy is dumb
compared to what iptables-nft does nowadays. I guess that should be my
follow-up task. :)

Cheers, Phil
