No idea, your reproducer gives this on my laptop:

 unshare -n bash repro.sh
net.ipv4.conf.veout.accept_local = 1
5.14.9-200.fc34.x86_64
conntrack v1.4.5 (conntrack-tools): connection tracking table has been emptied.
PING 172.30.30.2 (172.30.30.2) from 172.30.30.1 vein: 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 172.30.30.2 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms

conntrack v1.4.5 (conntrack-tools): 0 flow entries have been shown.

A bisection is needed to figure out what introduced a change.

However, if this is already changeed for a few releases then we can't
revert it again.
