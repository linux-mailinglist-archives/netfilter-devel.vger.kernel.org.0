Oh?  It looked complex to me:

but perhaps you only need a subset of this..?

No, the idea is to parse the RTSP data in the proxy, then inject the
expectations based on the exchanged/requested information.

No functional change wrt. a kernel based helper, except that the RTSP
data is parsed in userspace.

nf-next is closed at this time, I expect that it will open in the next
few days and that your patch will be accepted or given feedback by then.
