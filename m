Not for pktb_make: we never call pktb_free.

ATM I have to document that you must use separate Rx & Tx netlink buffers if
mangling at all, because otherwise you may get overlapping data moves or worse.

So I'm inclined to document about no length increase. But ...

There *is* room at the end of the buffer, as long as the received Netlink
message didn't fill it. We just need some way to know about it - maybe extra
args to the _data functions and maybe as well more _data helper functions to
keep it easy to use.

As well, I've been toying with the idea of not copying data out of the Rx buffer
at all, but rather building the verdict message around it. I have in mind a
user-space-only header to go at the front of the buffer, to be created before
receiving into it.

There's still the copies out from and back into kernel space - guess we're stuck
with those.

Cheers ... Duncan.
