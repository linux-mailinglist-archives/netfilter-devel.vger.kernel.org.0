For TCP fin/rst the removal from hardware occurs once once the
workqueue has a chance to run.

For UDP, or in case the TCP connection stalls or no packets are seeing
after 30 seconds, then the flow is removed from hardware after 30
seconds.

The IPS_HW_OFFLOAD_BIT flag should be cleaned up when the flow is
effectively removed from hardware.

Why do you want to clean it up earlier than that? With your approach,
the flag is cleared but the flow is still in hardware?
