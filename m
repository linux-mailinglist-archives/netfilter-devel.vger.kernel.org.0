I agree, and that's what the patch does: 'a path to the nft executable'
is the former behaviour, arbitrary command is the most up to date
information. (The "Since..." text above is my proposal for the commit
description, not for the README file.)

Would the following README text work for you?

  Test files are executable files matching the pattern <<name_N>>,
  where N has no meaning. All tests should return 0 on success.

  Since they are located with `find', test files can be put in any
  subdirectory.

Maybe saying "where N should be 0 in all new tests" would be less
strange?

I think both are significantly less helpful than my original version,
but at least they aren't wrong like the current text.

Proposed commit description, based on your comments:

  Since commit 4d26b6dd3c4c, test file name suffix no longer reflects
  expected exit code in all cases.

  Move the sentence "Since they are located with `find', test files can
  be put in any subdirectory." to a separate paragraph.
