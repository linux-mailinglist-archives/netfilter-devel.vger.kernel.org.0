This isn't correct, strictly speaking, as 'reject' is not a verdict.
The only verdicts accessible from userspace are accept and drop.
(and queue, but thats a historic wart that should not be mentioned).

'reject' is also not the only statement that ends rule/basechain evaluation,
other examples are redirect/dnat/snat/masquerade which will internally
issue an accept verdict.  Or synproxy, which will drop internally to
consume the incoming packet.

Thanks, this is a big improvement.

As above, reject isn't a verdict, it will 'drop' internally. Its also
not a 'drop' alias (it sends a reply packet).

Maybe the 'REJECT STATEMENT' section can be extended a little, but I
think its ok as-is.

Maybe we should mention that 'return' is the implicit thing at the end
of a user-created non-base chain?

Or do you think thats self-evident?

No, its not.
I think this warrants an example.

chain two { ... }
chain one {
	...
	goto two
	ip saddr ..   # never matched
}

chain in {
	hook input type filter ...
	jump one
	ip saddr .. # evaluated for all packets not dropped/accepted yet
}

-> base chain calls 'one' and remembers this location
-> 'one' calls 'two', but doesn't place it on chain stack.
-> at the end of 'two' / on 'return', we resume after 'jump one', not
   after 'goto'.

The sentence wrt. base chain policy is valid in case 'chain in' would
contain 'goto one', as it doesn't remember the origin location,
end-of-one / return is equal to explicit 'return' from the base chain.

Maybe it should say that it will instead resume after the last jump (if
there was any?, or not at all (base chain policy executes?)
