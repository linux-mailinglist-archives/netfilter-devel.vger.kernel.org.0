No worries, thanks for looking into it.

This is not sufficient per se - my series adds attributes to nftnl_set
to cover that. Passing the set itself is doable, I chose the
nftnl_set_desc way as it appeared a bit cleaner to me.

The two attributes hold a single byteorder value each. In order to
correctly print set elements, we need a value for each part of
concatenated elements. So for both key and data (key_end is always
identical to key), we need concat part length and byteorder.

I could introduce userdata attributes for the extra info to make things
more flexible, but it would bloat the data in kernel. OTOH this would
fix reverse path, when fetching data from kernel libnftnl lacks the
extra info to correctly dump the elements.
