Well, you started this thread with a kernel patch, so presumably we need
kernel changes in any case? ;)

But presumably that combination is enough to uniquely identify a table,
right? So we could just use the same tuple in the map insert API.
Doesn't *have* to be a numeric unique ID. And you were talking about
adding refcnts anyway in your follow-up message?

I'm not saying it's entirely a slam dunk, but having the reference to
flowtable entries be managed out of band does add a lot of flexibility
on the BPF side; in that sense it's analogous to how BPF map references
are handled.

XDP is namespaced as well, conceptually. I.e., ifindexes are used to
refer to interfaces, and a device will be removed from a devmap if it is
moved to a different namespace, that sort of thing.
