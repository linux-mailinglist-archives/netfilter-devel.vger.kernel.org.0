We are still discussing the json integration into tests/shell. I
suggest, let dust settle on each front before making more changes.

I still doubt `make check` provides any benefit to the release
process, which will exercise this path because of `make distcheck'
which I might have to relax it to `make dist' to skip this to ensure
release process is reliable.

I think all these tests should continously and provide reports to us,
but not necessarily integrate them into `make check'.
