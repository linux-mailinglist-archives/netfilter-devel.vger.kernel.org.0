I don't understand. Wasn't it your proposal to move things into the
transaction? Above you write: "element expiration should be refresh via
transaction instead". I asked what is special about timeout, why not
handle all element state reset the same way?

It's not just in the listing, the actual values underrun. A quota e.g.
will immediately deny.

I seem to lack context here. Is there an alternative to "strict"
serializing? Expressions' dump+reset callbacks must not run multiple
times at the same time for the same expression. At least not how they
are currently implemented.

I would suggest to leave things as-is until there's hard evidence why it
has to change now or there is a viable alternative implementation.

It's your call to make since you're the maintainer of the project, but
please stick to the standards you demand from other contributors.

Cheers, Phil
