My proposal was based on adding a new port-shift flag to the NAT
engine, for simplicity. So the NAT engine knows it has to fetch + add
delta to the existing port, instead of the explicit math + add, ie.
just let the NAT engine handle this port shift.

I'm proposing an alternative approach. Jeremy's approach is based on
iptables way of doing things, which is backwards for nftables because
we need to integrate new things with map.

I think we can just set on the new flag in the NAT engine to say: "hey
NAT engine, I instruct you to do a port shift on the packet, and this
is the delta".

ip daddr 10.0.0.1 tcp dport 55900-55910 dnat ip to ip saddr map { \
         192.168.127.0-129.168.127.128 : 1.2.3.4 . -55000,
         192.168.130/24 : 1.2.3.5 . -40000 } port-shift

and all the flexibility this provides, where one might need mappings.

I think it is a no-go: it will require multiple rules for more than
one mapping. Then, we could extend userspace to support for:

ip daddr 10.0.0.1 tcp dport 55900-55910 dnat ip to ip saddr map { \
         192.168.127.0-129.168.127.128 : 1.2.3.4 . 45900-45910 . 55900 } port-shift
                                                                 ^^^^^

where this is the base, or even infer it, but it is a bit of
complexity to handle that from userspace, even if this is not exposed
to the syntax (ie. infered from context), that would still need to be
exposed through datatype in an explicit map definition. That will be
awkward because datatype definition of the map will have something
like:

        ipv4_addr . inet_service . base

while listing will not show the base (I am talking about the
possibility of infering the base from context).

Jeremy uses the register to store the _BASE port.

Yes, adding a new type should not be a problem.

I think my proposal provides a simple way to support this, it just a
new flag in the NAT engine, few lines to handle it and new userspace
code to handle -/+offset in a map.

Your idea of doing it via payload + math is also good, but it would
just require more work to support this NAT port-shift feature in
userspace.

Does this help clarify? I am talking about a completely different
design for this feature, not so iptablish.
