At least, meters with names should be I think. There is now a way to
represent them

That's fine by now. But look, combining map and objects should be fine
in the future. A user might want to combine this by specifying an IP
address as the right hand side of a mapping and a stateful counter
(with a name) to be updated when matching on that element. This is not
supported yet though.

This looks fine.

OK, but only for anonymous meters.

We have a better way, more aligned to set/map definitions, to represent
updates to dynamic named sets from the packet path now.

We can probably introduce a syntax more aligned to the existing
set/map syntax for the _anonymous_ dynamic set/map case, so we don't
need this 'meter' keyword syntactic sugar.

> 3. patch nft to hide normal sets from 'nft list meters' output

This makes no sense for anonymous meters. Since the kernel picks the
name, I don't think nft should expose them to the user.

I would not go that path.

You are just hitting a limitation on the existing implementation.
People cannot make lookups on a dynamic set on existing kernels,
that's all.

There is no NFT_SET_EXPR support for nft_lookup either, is this a bug?
This infrastructure is just incomplete and just need to be finished.

There is no way to combine NFT_SET_MAP with NFT_SET_OBJ, but that is
also artificial, this is just happening again because the code is
incomplete and needs an extension.
