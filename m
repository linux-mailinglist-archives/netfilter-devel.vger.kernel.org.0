I mean field "pairs" in struct nft_among_data:

| struct nft_among_data {
|         struct {
|                 size_t cnt;
|                 bool inv;
|                 bool ip;
|         } src, dst; 
|         uint32_t pairs_hash;
|         /* first source, then dest pairs */
|         struct nft_among_pair pairs[0];
| };

So basically all pairs are being ignored. As long as the number and type (with
IP or not) of pairs and the invert flag matches, match data was considered
identical.

Could be. I considered it "good enough", but didn't try how easy it is
to cause a collision. Are you suggesting to use a more secure algorithm?

Thanks, Phil
