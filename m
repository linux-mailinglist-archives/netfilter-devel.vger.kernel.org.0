Turns out it is indeed possible to turn audit logging off again. I was
obviously misled from auditd not doing it (when killed at least).
Calling 'auditctl -e 0' inside the EXIT trap does the trick.
Implementing a custom audit listener tailored to our case is probably
still a good idea, but at least the biggest obstacle is gone IMO.
