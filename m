In the RDMA thread, I was informed that the trailing members' only
purpose is to serve as something of a shorthand:

Shortcut:
	struct ipt_entry *e = replace->elements;
The long way:
	struct ipt_entry *e = (void *)((char *)replace + sizeof(*replace));

But such gritty detail is often stowed away in some nice accessor
functions or macros. That's what's currently missing in spots
apprently.

	struct ipt_entry *next = get_next_blah(replace);

Then the get_next can do that arithmetic, we won't need
ipt_replace::elements, and could do away with the flexible array
member altogether, especially when it's not used with equal-sized
elements, and ipt_entry is of variadic size.
