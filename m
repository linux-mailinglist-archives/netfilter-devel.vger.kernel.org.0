Is this sufficient? There are attribute values that could have an
unknown/unsupported value, eg. exthdr type (assuming a new extension
is supported).

I am afraid setting incomplete for an unknown attribute also restricts
netlink extensibility.

Netlink allows for adding new attributes. Attributes also determine
semantics, eg. exthdr type restricts the semantics of other existing
attributes. There are also flags attributes which provide a hint on
what is support or not, toggling such flag allows kernel to reject
something that is not support.

I see, a binary netlink dump format.

I agree such netlink binary dump should be last resort.
