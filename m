Indeed, but why process A would pass this FD to B? Do you have real use 
cases in mind?

In case of confuse deputy attack, I'm convinced there is much more 
chance for B to just ask A to do nasty thing, no need to receive an FD, 
just to write data to the socket/IPC.

I think sockaddr defines the minimal requirement to deal with 
accept/bind/connect. The sin_family is require to define the type of 
address and port according, but the type is not.

The sandboxing/Landlock threat model is to restrict a process when it is 
sandboxed, but this sandboxing is a request from the same process (or 
one of its parent) that happen when it is more trustworthy (or at least 
has more privileges) than after it sandbox itself.

The process sandboxing itself can use several kernel features, and one 
of it is Landlock. In any case, it should take care of closing file 
descriptors that should not be passed to the sandboxed process.

The limits of sandboxing are the communication channels from and to 
outside the sandbox. The peers talking with sandboxed processes should 
then not be subject to confused deputy attacks, which means they must 
not enable to bypass the user-defined security policy (from which the 
Landlock policy is only a part). Receiving file descriptors should then 
not be more important than controlling the communication channels. If a 
not-sandboxed process is willing to give more right to a sandboxed 
process, by passing FDs or just receiving commands, then this 
not-sandboxed process need to be fixed.

This is the rationale to not care about received nor sent file 
descriptors. The communication channels and the remote peers must be 
trusted to not give more privileges to the sandboxed processes.

If a peer is malicious, it doesn't need to pass a file descriptor to the 
sandboxed process, it can just read (data) commands and apply them to 
its file descriptors. I think the ability to pass file descriptors 
should be seen as a way to improve performance by avoiding a user space 
process to act as a proxy receiving read/write commands and managing 
file descriptors itself. On the other hand, file descriptors could be 
used as real capabilities/tokens to manage access, but senders still 
need to be careful to only pass the required ones.

All this to say that being able to restrict actions on file descriptors 
would be useful for senders/services to send a subset of the file 
descriptor capabilities (cf. Capsicum), but not the other way around.

Right, the kernel (and then Landlock) is not enough to sandbox a 
complete environment, user space needs to be aware and be configured for 
that too.

I understand the desire to restrict as much as possible, but this 
require to add more code and then it increase the risk of bugs, whereas 
it might not be a big deal for attackers. I don't think the cost is 
worth it and I don't want to give a false sense of security that could 
let users think their application cannot communicate with the network if 
it can communicate with local processes connected to the network.

Yes, I meant that your a/b/c rules would apply for the current 
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_{CONNECT,BIND}_TCP types as well.
