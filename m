Unrelated to the expires vs. reset question, I wonder if one should
treat set elements with timeout as state themselves. If one leaves the
ruleset alone for long enough, they all will eventually vanish. So one
may argue the ruleset in its stateless form does not have elements in a
set with defined timeout.

I still doubt there's a use-case to do (1) or (2) in sets with
temporary elements.
