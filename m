Hi Phil,

Sorry for slowness.

Patch 1-4 can be integrated, they are relatively small.

Patches 5-6 will need a rebase due to my fix in that path.

Patch 7 is probably uncovering an issue with flowtable hardware
offload support, because I suspect _UNBIND is not called from that
path, I need to have a look.

I am inclined to postpone this batch to the next development cycle.
