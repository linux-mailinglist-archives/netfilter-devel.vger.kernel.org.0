This patch, and the 3 use cases are about how to treat SKIPs (and the
potential that a SKIP might happen due to a wrong reason, and how to
ensure this doesn't hide an actual bug).

Your reply makes me think that you consider this only relevant for the
"eval-exit-code" patches. It's not (although it could nicely work
together and solve some concerns). SKIPs already exist. This patch is
independent of that other patches or whatever the outcome of those is.

Unless you think, that the current SKIP mechanism (feature
detection/probing) in master is 100% reliable, and there is no need to
worry about SKIP hiding a bug. Then just consider yourself to be in
use-case 1 (which means to trust the automatism and not to care).


Use case 3 is enabled by this patch allows with the new=20
NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP_EXCEPT option. And it's the result of Florian
saying:

This is the current default already, and what was introduced with the
recent additions of SKIP. An effort from Florian.

It means running the test suite on distro kernels is not a supported
use case. I thought, Florian said that he does exactly that?

It also means, you cannot PASS the test suite on $DISTRO, after you
build the kernel and the corresponding nftables packages.

E.g. Fedora does not enable OSF module. OSF tests cannot pass. They are
consequently SKIP on Fedora. Nothing wrong with running the test suite
against Fedora kernel. Why would I be required to recompile another
kernel, unless I want to test a more recent kernel patch?

echo "export NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP=3Dy" >> ~/.bashrc

Also, there are only are reasonably small number of options that the
test suite has. See "tests/shell/run-tests.sh --help". The majority of
users don't need to care, the the default aims to do the thing they
want (use-case 1). Feel free not to care either. Then use-cases 2 and
use-cases 3 are just not yours. This doesn't mean you are not a
"maintainer", it just means you trust the SKIP automatism or keep track
of SKIPs via other means.

I think for a core developer, it would be useful to be aware and use
some of those options. There is quite useful stuff there.

None of the 3 use cases allow any "failures". Of course failures must
be avoided at all cost, because a failing test suite looses a lot of
it's benefits. There must be only PASS and some SKIP.


- Use case 1 is to not care about SKIPs and trust that they don't hide
a bug.

- Use case 2 is about not allowing any SKIPs at all. All tests must
PASS. NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP=3Dy ensures that. You'll probably need to
build your own kernel for this.

- Use case 3 is about allowing only a selected list of SKIPs (and get
an error when the SKIP/PASS state of a test is not as expected).
NFT_TEST_FAIL_ON_SKIP_EXCEPT=3D is the "selected list".
