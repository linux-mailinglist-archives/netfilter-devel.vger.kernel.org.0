I don't think the intent was to have fields swing in and out depending
on trigger.  The idea is to potentially permanently not include them in
this record type only.  The justification is that where they aren't
needed for the kernel trigger situation it made sense to delete them
because if it is a user context event it will be accompanied by a
syscall record that already has that information and there would be no
sense in duplicating it.
