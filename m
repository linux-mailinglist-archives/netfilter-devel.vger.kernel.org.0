Sorry, no thanks. If your setup is so complicated you rather send me an
image of the machine(s?) running it, you're in dire need to simplify
things in order to prepare for me helping out. Assuming that
'firewall.sh' is also really 57KB in size, I'll probably have a hard
time even making it do what it's supposed to, let alone reproduce the
problem.

Let's go another route: Before and after switching from legacy to nft
backend, please collect the current ruleset by recording the output of:

- iptables-save
- ip6tables-save
- nft list ruleset
- ipset list

Cheers, Phil
