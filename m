I'm not sure: keeping it in sync would mean that's not the default,
which might result in significant frustration. By the way,
iptables/tests/shell/run-tests.sh just calls unshare -n, instead.

In the past, I guess the --netns flag led to noise and a number of new
errors being found, but nowadays that part should be quite robust and I
don't see the noise.

I think that today the added benefit of an explicit option would come
from the fact that one can check what happened, on failure, on a
single test run, by checking rulesets in the init namespace afterwards.

However, the clean-up strategy is a bit inconsistent right now,
especially with the Python tests: after running some of them as single
runs you might still have a number of chains while rules are deleted --
so I think we should fix that before a flag becomes useful in this
sense.

That could also be achieved by running in a namespace with a known
name, which would need either a patch in the Python bindings here:
	https://github.com/shubham1172/unshare/blob/3e3cc4cd5128976a56601eb5764741fec9c242f8/unshare.c#L26

or wrapping commands with 'ip netns exec' as iptables-tests.py does.

If we do that, I guess we should also introduce a pause-on-fail
mechanism, cf.:
	https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20191206101549.4b05f74a@elisabeth/

All in all, from a functionality perspective, I don't think we're
losing anything with this patch -- if you ask me, I'd rather keep this
to avoid the current annoyance, make an explicit option usable in the
future, and then implement the option.
