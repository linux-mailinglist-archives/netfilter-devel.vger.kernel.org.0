I think the _SUBKEY_ infix is fine.

Problem with using NFT_SET_DESC_* for inner (nested) attributes is
that this matches the same prefix as top level netlink attributes.

Note there is NFT_SET_DESC_SIZE. If there is a NFT_SET_DESC_LEN that
is wrapped around NFT_SET_DESC_CONCAT (using same prefix) it might
look a bit misleading.

Having said this, although I started this debate about naming, I don't
have a strong opinion on all these names. As soon as the netlink
attribute scheme that is used allows for extensibility in the future,
such as allowing to add more descriptions for each subkey, I'll be fine.

Thanks.
