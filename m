I agree some sort of description is needed.

Yes, NFTNL_UDATA_SET_KEYBYTEORDER and NFTNL_UDATA_SET_DATABYTEORDER do
not support for concatenations.

There is also NFTA_SET_DATA_TYPE which should be deprecated in favour
if the userdata area.

There is a need to store the byteorder and length for integer types,
we agreed to not add integer_u{8,16,32,64} and integer_be{8,16,32,64}
to promote typeof to declare sets. This needs to be store in the
userdata area so the userspace set listing path have context to
interpret the netlink dump from the kernel.

I have scratch a bit of time to bootstrap this series:

Let me know, thanks for your patience.
