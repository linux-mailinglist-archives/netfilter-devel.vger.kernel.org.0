pktb_alloc2() still has a memcpy which is not needed by people that do
not need to mangle the packet.

This is not a problem, you only have to call this function with
ETH_HLEN to set the offset in case of bridge.

I'm fine if you still like the simplified pktb_alloc2() call, that's OK.

Revisiting, I would prefer to keep things simple. The caller should
make sure that pktb_mangle() has a buffer containing enough room. I
think it's more simple for the caller to allocate a buffer that is
large enough for any mangling.
