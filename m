(I think I missed the start of this thread?)

Whatever you do, only ever add new fields to the *end* of the record to
avoid confusing the userspace parser.  I vaguely remember looking at
adding a chain field and dismissed it.

So if this needs to be done, the string needs to be parsed to see if
extra fields have been added and print them at the end of the record.
The better approach is to add a parameter to carry that field and
optionally append it to the record.
