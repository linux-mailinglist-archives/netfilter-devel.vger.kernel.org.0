'evaluation ordering'?  Tables do matter in the sense that you can't

Maybe add the hook names here?  (preouting, input, and so on).

It took me a sec to parse this, maybe:

undefined.

Maybe: 'It accepts the packet only with respect to the current base
chain.'  The rest is already made clear by your next sentence:

please avoid 'deny' and use 'drop' everywhere.  In this case,

I'm not sure if the last part is needed as there is no such thing as a
base chain without a policy, so i would simplify this to:

Thus a packet is only accepted if no chain or rule issues a drop
verdict, including chain policies.

I'm not sure about this paragraph.  While its correct, base chains and
their priorities still have effects, e.g. if ip defragmentation has
taken place or not.  I think the previous paragraph is clear enough wrt.
packet acceptance.

As noted elsewhere, reject is just a more fancy drop, it should not be

Can that be reduced to something like:

Thus, base chains that use 'policy drop' must contain at least one accept rule or
must call another chain with an accept rule to avoid blocking all traffic.

'must reside in same table'?

Yes, this is why there is sometimes a reference to the call stack / or
chain stack.

'jump' makes a 'where am I' note, 'goto' doesn't.

I think we should try to simplify this.

jump and goto are almost the same, the only difference is that goto
doesn't make a 'where am I' note, so the evaluation of the *called*
chain behaves as if those rules were part of the chain that contains the
'goto' statement.

> +* A *return* verdict’s processing depend upon in which chain it is issued.

Hmm.  Not so sure.  Its always the same:

End evaluation of this chain and go back to where you came from.

Right.

Yes, but thats because the called chain executes in the context of the
calling chain.  Since thats a base chain, the return statement causes
a chain-stack-underflow.  It has same effect as 'return' in ANY chain:

1. End evaluation of the chain.
2. Go back to where you cam from.

We have nowhere else to go back to.

So all of those are identical:
chain base {
	hook ...
	...
# no more rules, implicit return -> base chain policy
}

----

chain base {
	hook ...
	...
	return # variant of above with explicit return
}

----

chain user {
	return
}

chain base {
	hook ...
	goto user
}

----

All end up with 'no terminal statement seen and no more rules to check'.

Why mention the comment statement here?

Comment is special, its not a statement from the evaluation
perspective. It tells the kernel to allocate some extra space to
store the comment data, the interpreter doesn't know its there.

I think this was already mentioned, also, nft should already be
informing the user that the rule has unreachable trailing statements.
