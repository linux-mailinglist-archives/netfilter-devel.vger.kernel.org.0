Out of curiosity I implemented the bits to support typeof keyword in
parser and scanner. It's a bit clumsy, but it works. I can do:

| nft add map t m2 '{ type typeof numgen random mod 2 : verdict; }'

(The 'random mod 2' part is ignored, but needed as otherwise it's not a
primary_expr. :D)

The output is:

| table ip t {
| 	map m2 {
| 		type integer : verdict
| 	}
| }

So integer size information is lost, this won't work when fed back.
There are two options to solve this:

A) Push expression info into kernel so we can correctly deserialize the
   original input.

B) As you suggested, have something like 'int32' or maybe better 'int(32)'.

I consider (B) to be way less ugly. And if we went that route, we could
actually use the 'int32'/'int(32)' thing in the first place. All users
have to know is how large is 'numgen' data type. Or we're even smart
here, taking into account that such a map may be used with different
inputs and mask input to fit map key size. IIRC, we may even have had
this discussion in an inconveniently cold room in Malaga once. :)

+1 for optimize not (yet). At least there's a certain chance that we're
spending much effort into optimizing a path which isn't even the
bottleneck later.

Cheers, Phil
