That point should be extended in the documentation, for sure:

nftlb daemon has exclusivity to the tables named with "nftlb": ip
nftlb, ip6 nftlb, netdev nftlb...

Only in that scope, nftlb will manage automatically the rules so the
admin shouldn't modify them manually (unless you know what you're
doing :). In regards to the flushing behavior, nftlb already checks if
the tables exist and then flush them if required, so the "flush
ruleset" is no longer needed. For more info, see this issue [0].

Said that, you're indeed able to integrate nftlb with your firewall or
clustering rules, creating your own table and playing with chain
priorities. Please refer to the developers guide to know the
priorities for every stage of nftlb [1].

So, if you want to place a firewall rule before a nat-based virtual
service, you've to use a priority less than -150 in prerouting. I'll
extend the documentation in that matter.

At the beginning of the project it was needed, but not today. With
stable releases should work pretty fine. I'll update it.

In regards to the manual, probably my fault :)

Well, numgen is one of them but not the only one. Hash expressions are
also helping in all of this. I'll update it for sure in the README.

Thank you for your comments!
