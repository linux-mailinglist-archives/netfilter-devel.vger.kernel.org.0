Phew...

I mean we have four parts in there:

       =20

That should IMO be uncontroversial and it's the counterpart to the
first sentence in drop's description.

That one is the counterpart to drop's "Unlike with an *accept*
verdict =E2=80=A6".

I'm not sure how we could shorten that without loosing something
valuable in terms of teaching.

- We can't shorten "Any other base chain (or regular chain called by
  such)" to e.g. "any other chain" because that would IMO not make it
  clear that this is only for a new base chain.
  If we leave out the "regular ones", people might come to think a drop
  in those might not be effective.
- We could leave out the whole "with a higher priority of the same hook
  as well as any other base chain (or regular chain called by such) of
  any later hook" ... but I think one would loose the nice
  understanding at which chains exactly the "overruling" (sorry O:-) )
  could happen.

That's basically the counterpart to drop's "Thus, if any base chain
uses drop as its policy=E2=80=A6"  sentence, =E2=80=A6 basically trying to =
explain the
consequences of the above.

I think it's nice to have because it teaches this concept of: "What is
needed for a package to pass ultimately? No drops in any chain - which
automatically means there's at least one accept".

Could perhaps be shortened to:
> Thus and merely from netfilter=E2=80=99s point of view, a packet is
> ultimately only accepted if none of the chains of the relevant hooks
> issues a *drop* verdict (be it explicitly or implicitly by policy or

I think the "of the relevant hooks" is important as packets do not go
through all hooks, do they?!

The whole "which already means..." could perhaps be dropped, but people
might first come to think "Wait... I never said accept and it still
goes through? WTF?!"... until they realise that "no drop" already means
"at least one accept".=20

Again, counterpart to the same in *drop*.

You mean further above and not in the "Given the semantics of" point!?

I mean effectively this "accept =3D packt moves on to the next chain [not
hook]", is explained in the first two sentences ("An *accept* verdict=E2=80=
=A6"
and "It accepts the packet only=E2=80=A6").

Shorten it that drastically,... with pure beginners who never used
nf/iptables before probably having zero clue on how a packet moves
through netfilter (let alone that this works like a pipeline)... IMO
doesn't really add to understanding.

If one has no knowledge, accept means just that "allow for good" and
drop the other way round.
So we must at least tell that accept does not ultimately accept, but
only for the base chain. Thus we also need to tell it moves on to all
other chains, but only those that are relevant.
And we must bring in the concept that drop is more powerful than accept
and can actually immediately and ultimately decide the fate.

Even if we'd already introduce the pipeline concept at that stage...
not sure how much that would add to understanding/confusion.
I mean implicitly, we already kinda have it, I'd say...

Well right now one one place is left where "overruling" is mentioned,
which you greenlit above ;-)
And that we could easily change to:
> it=E2=80=99s therefore not possible to have a *drop* changed to an *accep=
t*
> in a later chain.

which I actually did.



Will post v4 soon... not much changes for this patch though, so I guess
you won't be satisfied and we'll need another round. ;-)


Cheers,
Chris.
