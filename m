In tests/py, I see 330 lines explicitly stating the expected output as
it differs from the input ('grep "ok;" */*.t | wc -l'). Can we fix those
bugs first before we assume what the kernel returns is identical to user
input?

Say a script manages a rule (in JSON-equivalent) of:

| ip protocol tcp tcp dport '{ 22 - 23, 24 - 25}'

Both matches are elements in an array resembling the rule's "expr"
attribute. Nftables drops the first match, so if the script wants to
edit the ports in RHS of the second match, it won't find it anymore.
Also, the two port ranges are combined into a single one, so removing
one of the two ranges turns into a non-trivial problem.

Right now a script may apply its ruleset snippet and retrieve the
handles by:

| rc, ruleset, err = nftables.json_cmd(ruleset)

If the returned ruleset is not identical (apart from added attributes),
scripts will likely resort to a fire-n-forget type of usage pattern.

Proudly presenting reduced code size by dropping functionality is
cheating. Assume nobody needs the JSON interface, easily drop 5k LoC.
