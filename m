Giving hints is what I am supposed to do :-)

Yes, swap and eq -> not eq -- at least I think that should work and
would make something like 18:00-07:00 work.

The kernel has no idea what a time zone is, the tz_dsttime setting
comes from userspace, typically during boot via hwclock(8).

IIRC it only flags if we're in 'daylight saving time' or not,
i.e. 0 for CET and 1 in CEST case.
