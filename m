Thanks for your reply! Perhaps this is the way to go, although this 
might have
much broader implications since there are tons of other callers to take 
into account.

I'm not sure whether rhashtable's size also directly depends on user 
input, I was only
aware of x_table since this is the case we ran into specifically.

The allocated physical memory won't be contiguous only for fallback 
cases (which should be rare),
I assume in that case the hardware operation may end up being more 
expensive with larger scatter-gather
lists etc. So most of the time such code can take optimized paths for 
fully contiguous memory. This is not
the case for x_tables etc.
