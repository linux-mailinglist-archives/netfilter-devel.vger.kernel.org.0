I would say: "having different dissection _operation modes_ depending on
where the packets enters the dissector is the expected behaviour", so
the dissector code adapts to the use-case.

I think this will not work for the netfilter use-case, such
pseudo-random number would be then generated in the scope of the chain
and that packet could go over several chains while being processed.
Thus, displaying different IDs for the same packet.

it sounds like a temporary workaround. I understand your concern that
it requires a much larger patch to pass net to the flow dissector
infrastructure.

I am afraid syzkaller and such will still hit this for Christoph,
since DEBUG_NET is usually recommended to be turned on in such case.

Another possibility is that netfilter stops using the dissector code
for the tracing infrastructure at the cost of replicating code.

Thanks.
