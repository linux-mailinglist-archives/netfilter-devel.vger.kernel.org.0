Hello! Sorry for the late reply, I was on a small business trip.

Thanks a lot for this catch, without doubt MPTCP should be controlled
with TCP access rights.

In that case, we should reconsider current semantics of TCP control.

Currently, it looks like this:
* LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP: Bind a TCP socket to a local port.
* LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP: Connect an active TCP socket to a
   remote port.

According to these definitions only TCP sockets should be restricted and
this is already provided by Landlock (considering observing commit)
(assuming that "TCP socket" := user space socket of IPPROTO_TCP
protocol).

AFAICS the two objectives of TCP access rights are to control
(1) which ports can be used for sending or receiving TCP packets
     (including SYN, ACK or other service packets).
(2) which ports can be used to establish TCP connection (performed by
     kernel network stack on server or client side).

In most cases denying (2) cause denying (1). Sending or receiving TCP
packets without initial 3-way handshake is only possible on RAW [1] or
PACKET [2] sockets. Usage of such sockets requires root privilligies, so
there is no point to control them with Landlock.

Therefore Landlock should only take care about case (2). For now
(please correct me if I'm wrong), we only considered control of
connection performed on user space plain TCP sockets (created with
IPPROTO_TCP).

TCP kernel sockets are generally used in the following ways:
* in a couple of other user space protocols (MPTCP, SMC, RDS)
* in a few network filesystems (e.g. NFS communication over TCP)

For the second case TCP connection is currently not restricted by
Landlock. This approach is may be correct, since NFS should not have
access to a plain TCP communication and TCP restriction of NFS may
be too implicit. Nevertheless, I think that restriction via current
access rights should be considered.

For the first case, each protocol use TCP differently, so they should
be considered separately.

In the case of MPTCP TCP internal sockets are used to establish
connection and exchange data between two network interfaces. MPTCP
allows to have multiple TCP connections between two MPTCP sockets by
connecting different network interfaces (e.g. WIFI and 3G).

Shared Memory Communication is a protocol that allows TCP applications
transparently use RDMA for communication [3]. TCP internal socket is
used to exchange service CLC messages when establishing SMC connection
(which seems harmless for sandboxing) and for communication in the case
of fallback. Fallback happens only if RDMA communication became
impossible (e.g. if RDMA capable RNIC card went down on host or peer
side). So, preventing TCP communication may be achieved by controlling
fallback mechanism.

Reliable Datagram Socket is connectionless protocol implemented by
Oracle [4]. It uses TCP stack or Infiniband to reliably deliever
datagrams. For every sendmsg(2), recvmsg(2) it establishes TCP
connection and use it to deliever splitted message.

In comparison with previous protocols, RDS sockets cannot be binded or
connected to special TCP ports (e.g. with bind(2), connect(2)). 16385
port is assigned to receiving side and sending side is binded to the
port allocated by the kernel (by using zero as port number).

It may be useful to restrict RDS-over-TCP with current access rights,
since it allows to perform TCP communication from user-space. But it
would be only possible to fully allow or deny sending/receiving
(since used ports are not controlled from user space).

Restricting any TCP connection in the kernel is probably simplest
design, but we should consider above cases to provide the most useful
one.
