Moving my ipsets to nftables sets, however, has proven to be a major pain point - to a degree where I started wondering whether nftables sets are actually ready to replace existing ipset workflows yet.

> Moving on without the auto-merge feature, I started testing sets with actual lists I use. The initial setup (meaning populating the sets for the first time) went fine. But when I tried to update them atomically, i.e. use a script file that would have a 'flush set' statement in the beginning and then an 'add element' statement with all the addresses I wanted to add to it, the system seemed to lock up. As it turns out, updating existing large sets is excessively slow - to a point where it becomes unusable if you work with multiple large sets. I reported the details including an example and performance indicators here [4]. The only workaround for this (that keeps atomicity) I found so far is to reload the complete firewall configuration including the set definitions. But that has other unwanted side-effects such as resetting all counters and so on.

> As a workaround for the auto-merge issues described above (and also for another use case), I was looking into the possibility to reference sets within a set so I could create a set for each source list I use and reference them in a single set so I could match them all at once without duplicating rules for multiple sets. To be clear, I'm not really sure whether this is supposed to work all. I found some commits which suggested to me it might be possible [5][6]. Nevertheless, I couldn't get this to work.

For the record, these two issues are now fixed in git.

Thank you for reporting.
