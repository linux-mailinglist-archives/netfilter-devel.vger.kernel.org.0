I didn't understand: so it's really bad? Because sure, I see that
running the test scripts you shared now takes much longer, but I wonder
how far that is from actual use cases.

Hmm, but wait, that was exactly the problem I introduced (or at least
my understanding of it): if subtrees of entirely inactive nodes hide
(by affecting how we descend the tree) active nodes (that affect the
overlap decision), we can't actually reach any conclusion.

It's fine as long as it's inactive leaves, or single nodes, but not
more.

Let's say we need to insert element with key 6, as interval start,
given this tree, where:

- (s) and (e) mark starts and ends
- (i) and (a) mark inactive and active elements

                 4 (s, i)
                 /      \
                /        \
        2 (s, i)          7 (e, i)
        /      \          /      \
       /        \        /        \
  1 (s, a)  3 (e, a)  5 (s, i)  8 (s, i)

we visit elements with keys 4, 7, 5: we have an inactive start on the
left (5), an inactive end to the right (7), and we don't know if it
overlaps, because we couldn't see 1 and 3. Depending on how hard we
tried to fix bugs we hit in the past, we'll consider that an overlap
or not.

Without inactive elements, we would have this tree:

1 (s, a)
     \
      \
    3 (e, a)

where we visit elements with keys 1, 3: we find an active start on
the left, and then the corresponding end, also to the left, so we
conclude that start element with key 6 doesn't overlap.

This simplifies the handling of those cases, we wouldn't need all those
clauses anymore, but I really think that the existing problem comes from
the fact we can *not* descend the tree just by selecting key values.
