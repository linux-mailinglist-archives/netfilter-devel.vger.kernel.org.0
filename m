Great :)

Yes, I don't know how to stop it.  IIRC exit() just makes afl-fuzz resume
with next cycle.

Yes.  I just want it to stop burning cpu cycles if kernel is already
tainted.

Yes, it should not continue to burn cpu cycles.

I had such code but removed it for this version.

I can send a followup patch to re-add it but I think that it is better
for kernel fuzzing to extend knft acordingly, as nft is restricted by
the input grammar wrt. the nonsense that it can create.

Yes, that would be good.  Note that I still primarily use it with
netlink-ro mode to not exercise he kernel, its easy to make graph
validation (or abort path) take very long to finish.

There is still a patch series in the queue to limit jumps in nftables
and I did not yet have time in looking at the abort path, Its simply not
an issue for normal cases (you assume the input is going to be
committed...).  But for faster netlink-rw/knft fuzzing it would make
sense to look into async abort (like we do for commit cleanup).
