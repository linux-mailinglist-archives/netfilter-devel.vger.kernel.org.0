UINT64_MAX marker always reports ERANGE in older kernels so user knows
this is not supported, assuming new nft and old kernel, then in old
kernels:

- if "flags timeout" is used, that means "never expires" in sets which
  is correct.

- BUT if "timeout 1h" is used, then timeout 0 means use default set timeout
  which is makes behaviour different in old and new kernels for this.

I can explore using 0 as marker as you suggest if you think that
informing the user that this is not supported is not so important.

Note, though, that timeout updates are completely ignored in new
kernels, I don't have a way to report timeout updates are not
implemented. Older kernels follow a lazy approach.
