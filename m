Confusion, no. But the version numbers certainly suffer from ossification. The
1. prefix has been since over 20 years. It's like https://0ver.org/, just
offset by one. The kernel has ditched its ossified prefix (2.6.) over ten years
ago as well.

Speaking of 0ver (and reading past the sarcasm), it's time to move off 0.
for e.g. libconntrack*, conntrack-tools et al.
