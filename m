Subject: Re: [PATCH nft 2/3] netlink_linearize: incorrect netlink bytecode
 with binary operation and flags

I was quite overwhelmed by the whole thing, so I might not have made
my point clear.

While I find e.g. `tcp flags fin,ack,rst` being not the same as `tcp
flags { fin, ack, rst }` confusing, in this case it is still
"reasonable", as we can say that in the former it is a
"comma-separated list" (hence no space), while in the latter it is a
set (hence the spaces).

The real issue here is that a comma-separated list itself can have
totally different meanings. For example,

1. If (just) `fin,rst,ack`, it means "any of the bits set".
2. If `== fin,rst,ack`, it means (fin | rst | ack)
3. If `fin,rst,ack / fin,rst,ack`, it means (fin | rst | ack). *(For
both the value and the mask)*
4. If `== fin,rst,ack / fin,rst,ack`, it means (fin | rst | ack).
*(For both the value and the mask)*

So how could anyone have thought in the first case `fin,rst,ack` does
not have the same meaning as it does in the other cases? That's what I
would call "unreasonable". Also, if in any case e.g. (just) `syn` is
not considered a (single-value) "comma-separated list", it's
"unreasonable" as well.

Or in other words, I don't find a behavior/shortcut like, "if a mask
is not specified explicitly, a mask that is equal to the value is
implied, yet not when we compare the value (e.g. ==)", sensible /
sensical. (Would anyone?)

And you know what, comparing this with the `ct state` is unfair. The
fact that you did so sort of explains why we end up in this...mess.
(Not trying to say it's your fault but rather, how the issue could
have happened.)

In the case of `ct state`, while we use the different bits for the
states, the states themselves are mutually exclusive (AFAIK, e.g. a
packet can't be new and established at the same time). People assume
e.g. `related,established` to be *practically* equivalent to `{
related, established }` not because they would think like, "generally
a comma-separated list should mean any of states", but either because
they know in advance a packet can only be of either, or, they assume
such similar syntax should mean the same thing. (The truth is, `ct
state related,established` is NOT *logically* the same as `ct state {
related, established }`; the former will be true for a packet if its
state can be / is related | established.)
