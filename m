+BUGS
+-----
+COMMAND LINE PARSING
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+The syntax used in nftables is prone to cause problems when given on command
+line. For instance, *semi-colon* is used in all relevant shells to delimit
+commands.
+
+In some places, *quoted strings* are expected. If not escaped, the shell will
+silently eat them away.
+
+There is also an internal problem regarding *negative priority values* (e.g.,
+when defining base-chains or flowtables): The leading dash catches getopt's
+attention which in turn assumes user specified an unknown option flag. Getopt
+allows to ignore any option-like parameter after the first non-option, but
+that would prevent typical commands like *nft list ruleset -a*.
+
+There are multiple ways to mitigate these issues: Shells can be prevented from
+interpreting special characters by prefixing them with the escape character
+(typically *backslash*), getopt won't recognize options following a parameter
+consisting of *two dashes* alone (which in turn is ignored as well). Probably
+the easiest way to avoid even unforseen issues is to enclose the whole
+nftables syntax in *single quotes*. This turns the multiple non-option words
+on command line into a single argument which is passed to the parser just like
+before but the shell as well as getopt will leave it alone.
