Not at all: One has to *install* it and even pass --prefix to configure,
otherwise binaries end in /usr/local and nothing's overwritten. One may
even use 'make uninstall' to get rid of the stuff again.

That same person mentions RPMs and explicitly requests a user space
package version upgrade. I really think you're interpreting too much
into that initial email. Besides that, if you see a lack of crucial
information, why don't you chime in and fill that gap instead of
pointlessly discussing how my response may or may not cause harm? I may
be an idiot who likes to troll people, but who are you choosing to point
that out instead of investing the time helping those you're trying to
defend?

Cheers, Phil
