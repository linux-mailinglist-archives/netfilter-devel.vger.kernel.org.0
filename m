Do we still need this one after this revised patch?
If we do, the help text has to be fixed, after your patch, be-liberal
turns off all sequence number/window checks.  The revised text implies
it only has to do with RSTs.

Alternative would be to add another sysctl, or turn the existing sysctl
into integer (0, off, 1 current behaviour (sequence check on for rst
only, 2 off for everything).

I will send this patch for inclusion tomorrow or later today.

Pablo, please mark both patches as "Changes Requested".

I will deal with the 2nd patch and will resend it, with the more liberal
handing of RST when conntrack entry is closing.

Ali, if you still think the first patch is required please submit a new
version with at least a revised help text.
