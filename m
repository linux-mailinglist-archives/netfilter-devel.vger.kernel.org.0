I was wondering what we should do with it going forward. Looks like it
was added by 8f4c1f9b049d ("[NETLINK]: Introduce nested and byteorder
flag to netlink attribute") which says:

    The byte-order flag is yet unused, it's intended use is to
    allow automatic byte order convertions for all atomic types.

That idea clearly never gained traction. If nobody knows of any use of
the flag outside of ipset I'm tempted to send a patch to officially
deprecate it and possibly reuse that bit for something else later on?
