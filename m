It does! You can use ipsets with iptables-nft just as before. If your
experience differs, that's a bug we should fix.

Not good. Did you find out *why* nothing worked anymore? Would you maybe
care to share your script and ruleset with us?

That sounds weird, if it reliably drops everything why does it complain
with EEXIST?

I'm not the one to make that call, but IMHO the plan is for
iptables-legacy to become irrelevant *before* it is dropped from
upstream repositories. So as long as you are still using it (and you're
not an irrelevant minority ;) nothing's at harm.

Cheers, Phil
