Looks like a kernel bug, kernel is selecting the fixed size hash with
the dynamic flag. That should not happen.

The comment is correct. NFT_SET_EVAL semantics is "this set can be
updated from the packet path", this helps the kernel selects a set
backend that implements the ->update interface.

The expression is option, if the netlink attribute to describe the
extension is set, then it used.

No, because the dynamic flag is not set.

Probably it would be good to implicitly set on timeout flag if dynamic
flag is set on, just like it happens with set size. To relax the
control plane interface a bit (IIRC the user currently gets an error
if you forget to set the timeout flag in a set that is updated from
the packet path).

I think we're just being lucky :-)

Sure.
