No, that would be too extreme.

I think all the information should be passed as individual netlink
attributes.

In mean time, we gained ability to set timeout policies and conntrack
helpers via nft_ct, I think you can look at how they are implemented
to get an idea of how to gather the data that gets passed to
nf_ct_expect_init().

netfilter: nft_ct: add helper set support
and
7e0b2b57f01d183e1c84114f1f2287737358d748
netfilter: nft_ct: add ct timeout support

table ip filter {
       ct timeout customtimeout {
               protocol tcp;
               l3proto ip
               policy = { established: 120, close: 20 }
       }

       chain output {
               type filter hook output priority filter; policy accept;
               ct timeout set "customtimeout"
       }
}

table inet myhelpers {
  ct helper ftp-standard {
     type "ftp" protocol tcp
  }
  chain prerouting {
      type filter hook prerouting priority 0;
      tcp dport 21 ct helper set "ftp-standard"
  }
}

So for expectations this might look like this:
table inet foo {
 ct expectation myexp {
	protocol udp;
	dport 6970-7170;
	timeout 5m;
	dmask 255.255.255.255;
	smask 255.255.255.255;
 }

 ip dport 554 ct expectation set "myexp"
}

nft_ct object evaluation would call nf_ct_expect_alloc() based
on current pkt->skb->_nfct and it would pass all info that is configured in
'myexp' already to nf_ct_expect_init().

The tuples to expect would be taken from pkt->skb->_nfct one.
I think for initial implementation, smask/dmask isn't needed so we
could just use the full expectet address.
Later on, we could extend this to also allow sport, classes, and so on.

Using the obect infrastructure allows to assign the expectation via maps,
without extra code, for example:

ct helper set tcp dport map {21 : "cthelp1", 2121 : "cthelp1" }
ct expectation set ip protocol map { 6 : "tcpexpect" , ...

You will need to touch both libnftables and nftables.
You can look at nft/libnftnl history for the helper and timeout support.
