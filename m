So it seems the valid options are:
*dup to* 'device'			# netdev ingress hook only
*dup to* 'address'  			# ipv4/ipv6 only
*dup to* 'address' *device* 'device'	# ipv4/ipv6 only

From a user perspective being able to specify "dup to 'device'" is something
that is useful to be able to specify. I am now using:
  dup to ip[6] daddr device 'device'
but it seems to me that having to specify "to ip[6] daddr" is unnecessary.

So far as I can see, it would be quite straightforward to allow "dup to
'device'" to be specified and for nft to handle it with an implied "to ip[6]
addr". I am happy to produce a patch to do this if it would be helpful.

I am also happy to submit a revised patch for statements.txt if that would be
useful.
