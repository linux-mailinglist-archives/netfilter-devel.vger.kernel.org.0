Sounds good!

Main goal was to keep the bit-fiddling away from users, but a method
which accepts an array of flag names (or flag values) and does the
binary OR'ing should serve fine, too.

I was referring to get_debug() and set_debug() methods of class
Nftables. The getter returns an array of debug flag names, the setter
accepts either a single flag name/value or an array of those.
