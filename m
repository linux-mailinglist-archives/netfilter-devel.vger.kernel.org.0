Thanks Ivanov, this looks really good!  Let me some time to review the
rest.

I think it would make sense to have one field per file kind (not
necessarily type) because not all actions would make sense.

I'm OK with this name for now unless someone has a better proposition.

handled_access_net is indeed quite generic, but the question is: would
this new access right make sense for the net_port rule?  In the case of
socket creation, this is not the case because we don't know at this time
which port will be used.

Potentially anything that would be possible to check against a port.

Correct.  It's worth it mentionning this rationale in the patch
description.

Günther's suggestion would be a good optimization, but I agree that it
should be part of another series.  We also need to keep in mind that the
layer level should be known for audit and debugging reasons.

Same :)
