Funny, I thought about doing that in the past and stopped before I could
even type 'unshare'. Silly, everything will break, I thought.

Nope, not at all, now that you say that... both 'unshare -n
./nft-test.py' and 'unshare -n ./run-tests.sh' worked flawlessly.

A minor concern I have is that if CONFIG_NETNS is not set we can't do
that. But we could add a check and run them in the init namespace if
namespaces are not available, that looks reasonable enough.

I would do that from the main script itself (and figure out how it
should be done in Python, too), just once, it looks cleaner and we
don't change how test scripts are invoked. Something like this:
