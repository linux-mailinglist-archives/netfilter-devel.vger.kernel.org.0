I don't think so, they are zeroed out, see nf_ct_get_tuple();
init_conntrack copies the entire thing so I don't see how stack garbage
can be placed in struct nf_conn and thus I don't see how registers can
contains crap.  Do they?  If yes, please provide a bit more information
on how this happens (e.g. kmsan report or similar).

Thats a userspace bug; userspace that makes use of NFT_CT_SRC/DST must
provide the dependency.

This is not the kernels job, the kernel only must make sure that we
can't crash or otherwise leak hidden state (e.g. kernel memory
contents).

Thats because not all kernel releases have NFT_CT_DST_IP(6), they were
added later.  Switching userspace will break compatibility with older
kernels.  That said, this key was added in v4.17 so we could change
nftables now to always use NFT_CT_DST_IP(6) instead and avoid adding
the NFPROTO implicit dep for this case.

But why?  As far as I can see nothing is broken.

We don't force dependencies for other expressions either, why make
an exception here?

I'm sorry that I did not mention this earlier; in v1 i assumed intent
was to zap unused code (but its still used by nft), hence i did not
mention the above.

We should not force this unless not doing it causes crash or
other misbehaviour, such as leaking private kernel memory content.

Ouch, sorry, I think this is a non-starter, nft_expr
should be kept as small as possible.

That said, I don't see why its necessary to add this pointer here,
it could be provided via nft_ctx for example.
