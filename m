An upcoming 1.0.9 might be a good chance to switch upstream numbering
scheme: Depending on whether it is deemed acceptable to reorder patches
in public git history, one could make 1.0.9 contain only the fixes since
1.0.8 and release a 1.1.0 containing what remains. And from then on
collect just fixes to 1.1.0 into 1.1.N and new features into 1.2.0.

Assuming that downstream does its own "stable releases" already,
skipping a 1.0.6.1 or 0.9.8.1 should be OK. Was a 0.9.10, being
0.9-stable, acceptable or are there too many new features between 0.9.8
and 0.9.9?

Cheers, Phil
