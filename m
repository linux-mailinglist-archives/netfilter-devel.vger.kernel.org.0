Thanks! I just had a quick look, I think the new set implementation
would indeed look more elegant this way. As to design choices, I'm
afraid I'm not familiar enough with the big picture to comment on the
general idea, but my uninformed opinion agrees with this approach. :)

For what it's worth, I'd review this in deeper detail next.

On my side, I'm almost done with nft/libnftnl/kernel changes for the
NFT_SET_DESC_CONCAT thing. How should we proceed? Do you want me to
share those patches so that you can add this bit on top, or should this
come first, or in a separate series?

I could also just share the new nft/libnftnl patches (I should have them
ready between today and tomorrow), and proceed adapting the kernel part
according to your changes.

Related question: to avoid copying data around, I'm now dynamically
allocating a struct nft_data_desc in nf_tables_newset() with a
reference from struct nft_set: desc->dlen, desc->klen, desc->size would
all live there, together with the "subkey" stuff.

Is it a bad idea? I can undo it easily, I just don't know if there's a
specific reason why those fields are repeated in struct nft_set.
