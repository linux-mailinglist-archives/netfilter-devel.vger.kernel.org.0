I did not to avoid "dead" entries in the hook list (with ops.dev gone,
there's nothing left identifying the hook). But it's only temporary and
maybe cleans up the diffs, will give it a go.

Hmm. I could introduce NFTA_HOOK_INACTIVE_DEVS which contains only those
entries missing in NFTA_HOOK_DEVS. This shouldn't bloat the dumps too
much (apart from the added overhead) and won't change old user space
behaviour.

Why can't they co-exist? I.e., NFTA_HOOK_DEV{,S} continues to behave as
before and NEWDEV/DELDEV modify the list of existing chains/flowtables.
An explicit GETDEV to dump currently active interfaces seems reasonable,
especially with wildcard specifiers in mind.

I had the same mechanism we use for wildcard ifname matching in mind
which is to specify a name length which either includes or excludes the
terminating NUL-char. Using strncmp() is sufficient then. Or do you
think more advanced (e.g. "enp*s0") wildcards are useful?

Since one has to specify the specific chain or flowtable to add to
anyway, one could just add NFTA_DEV_CHAIN and NFTA_DEV_FLOWTABLE
attributes, which are mutually exclusive and together with
NFTA_DEV_TABLE identify the object to manipulate.

This is for user space to remain compatible to older kernels, right?

Yes, adding NEWDEV/DELDEV notifications is a nice approach!

ACK.

As a first implementation, I would just forbid such combinations.
Assuming "tap*" is just "tap" with length 3 and "tap0" is "tap0\0" with
length 5, modifying the duplicate hook check in
nf_tables_parse_netdev_hooks() to perform a strncmp(namea, nameb,
min(lena, lenb)) should suffice.

Another option avoiding maintenance of an exclusion list would be to
just add a new interface to the first chain/flowtable with matching hook
in the list. This should work since 'nft list ruleset' does not sort the
ruleset, so 'add chain t b; add chain t a' is a meaningful difference to
'add chain t a; add chain t b'.

The exclusion list approach either means tracking a list of active
hooks' matching names in each wildcard hook or some preference when
searching a hook for a new interface. All this may become increasingly
complicated by stuff like one hook for 'eth*' and another for 'et*'.

My motivation for this series is an open ticket complaining about the
inability to define a flowtable for an interface which is created by
NetworkManager (which depends on nftables service for startup).

A related (but not complained so far) issue is in reverse direction: If
the interface vanishes before nftables service saves the ruleset upon
shutdown, the dump will be incomplete.

I consider wildcard interface hooks merely a (nice) side-effect from
fixing the above. Which should not require too much additional work.

Thanks for your review,
