ack, how do you plan to handle this?

There are two options here:

- Add more raw expressions and dump them, eg. meta@15, where 15 is the type.
  This is more compact. If there is a requirement to allow to restore
  this from older nftables versions, then it might be not enough since
  maybe there is a need for meta@type,somethingelse (as in the ct direction
  case).
- Use a netlink representation as raw expression: meta@1,3,0x0x000000004
  but this requires dumping the whole list of attributes which is chatty.

Or explore a combination of both.

I am telling all this because I suspect maybe this "forward
compatibility" (a.k.a. "old tools support the future") could rise the
bar again and have a requirement to be able to load rulesets that
contains features that old tools don't understand.

Maybe it is worth exploring what I propose above instead of displaying
"expression is incomplete"?
