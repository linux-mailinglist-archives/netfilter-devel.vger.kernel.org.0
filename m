Then, better keep it back?

I don't expect to ever have such a large number of types. Specifically
because there are API restrictions that apply in this case.

I was trying to figure out what this is fixing.

This TYPE_MAX will not ever become very large to require 64-bits.
With an implementation where enum is taken as signed, then this should
be sufficient too:

     if (type > TYPE_MAX)

If this is not fixing up anything right now, I would prefer to keep
this back.

I'll take this series except this one.

Thanks.
