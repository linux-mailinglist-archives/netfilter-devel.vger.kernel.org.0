Hi,

Just a followed up after including your ctnetlink update in the last
upstream pull request for net-next.

I think you already mentioned, but it should be possible to extend
the conntrack utility to support for kernel side filtering seamlessly.

The idea is to keep the userspace filtering as a fallback, regardless
the kernel supports for CTA_FILTER or not.

I'm missing one feature in the CTA_FILTER, that is the netmask
filtering for IP addresses. It would be also good to make this fit
into libnetfilter_conntrack.

Probably this patch can be extended to include two objects, the
conntrack object that represents the exact matching (values) and
another one that represent the mask:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20200129094719.670-1-romain.bellan@wifirst.fr/

The mask object would only work for the IP address and mark.

Probably rename NFCT_FILTER_DUMP_TUPLE to NFCT_FILTER_DUMP, which
would provide the most generic version to request kernel side
filtering.

Thanks.
