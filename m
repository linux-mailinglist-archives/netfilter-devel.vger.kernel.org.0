Yes.  It becomes irrelevant because the entire ip forward stack
becomes irrelevant. Prerouting and postrouting hooks get skipped
too, would you restore those as well?

Yes. Its expected.  Entire IP stack is bypassed, including MTU
checks, xfrm policy lookups and so on.

Yes.  They have to understand the packet is handled in a *completely
different* way, the IP stack is bypassed, including ipsec/xfrm policies,
icmp checks, mtu checks, and so on.

This is also why the fastpath *must* push some packets back to
normal plane: so that packet passes through ip_forward() which does
all this extra work.

Some packets cannot be added to flowtable either even if user asks
for it, e.g. when ip options are enabled.

You could try to do this for the 'nft -f' case, but I doubt its worth
it, see below for an example.

Err. no.  Because its impossible to do unless you stick a
nf_hook_slow() call into the "fastpath", otherwise you will diverge
from what normal path is doing.  And its still not the same,
feature-wise, because we e.g. cache route info rather than per-packet
lookup.

Flowtable software path is the *fallback* for when we don't have offload
capable hardware, it bypasses entire ip forward plane and packets take
a different, shorter code path, iff possible.

Yes, nftables userspace could be augmented so that 'nft -f' could
display a warning if there is a rule other than 'conntrack
established,related accept' or similar as first line.

But I don't think its worth doing, f.e. someone could be doing
selective offload based on src/dst networks or similar.

Updating/expanding flowtable documentation would be welcome of course.

You will have to add a call to nf_hook_slow, or at very least to
nft_do_chain...

netdev:in/egress is the existing plumbing that we have that
allows for this, and I think that this is what should be used
here.

Unfortunately its not, we cannot make waters murkier and just pretend
HW offloads don't exist.  Behavior for "flags offload;" presence or
absence should be identical (in absence of bugs of course).

So you propose to software-offload all mangle statements and
prune all other rules...?

How is that any better than what we do now?

It would be nice to give a warning but I don't think its feasible.
Consider something like

 chain forward {
  ip dscp set cs3
  ct state established,related accept
  ip saddr @should_offload_nets flow add @ft
 }

Should this generate a warning?

Also, because of forward path bypass even if the ruleset is just doing:

ct state established,related
ip saddr @can_offload flow add @ft

Packet flow is not the same as without "flow add" for a large swath of
packets, as no prerouting or postrouting hooks are executed either.

I still think that my critique stands, pruning other rules and
magically considering some while completely disregarding their context
is not a good idea.

Now, theoretically, you could add this:

chain fast_fwd {
	hook flowtable @f1 prio 0
	ip dscp set cs3
}

Where this chain is hooked into the flowtable fastpath *ONLY*.

However, I don't like it either because its incompatible with
HW offloads and we can be sure that once we allow this people
will want things like sets and maps too 8-(

If you want to make software fastpath fast(er), explore a XDP program
that can handle the post-offload packet funneling via xdp_frames to get rid of
sk_buff allocation overhead.

Program should make upcalls to stack (costly) to get back to software
and otherwise appear like HW offload-capable device from flowtable point
of view.  Some parts of the flowtable infrastructure could probably be exposed
via kfuncs so that certain functionality such as NAT doesn't have to be
(re)implemented.

Requires lots of code churn in flowtable support code to get rid
of sk_buff * arguments whereever possible.

There is also pending xmit_more support (skb trains/aggregation),
perhaps it will land in 6.5 cycle.
