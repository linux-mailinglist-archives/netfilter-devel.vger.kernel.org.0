I also prefer if there is oneline description in the patch. My
suggestions:

* patch 1/3, not clear to me what "copy edit" means either.

* patch 2/3, what is the intention there? a path to the nft executable
  is most generic way to refer how you use $NFT, right?

* patch 3/3, I'd add a terse sentence so I do not need to scroll down
  and read the update to README to understand what this patch updates.
  I'd suggest: "Test files are located with find, so they can be placed
  in any location."

Regarding reference to 4d26b6dd3c4c, not sure it is worth to add this
to the README file. The test infrastructure is only used for internal
development use, this is included in tarballs but distributors do not
package this.

So please address Phil's feedback.

Thanks.
