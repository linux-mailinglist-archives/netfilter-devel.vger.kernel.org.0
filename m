Sure... but for a beginner (which this chapter is IMO primarily
intended for) - and who we must expect doesn't know about iptables
either - it may all but obvious whether netfilter/nftables would
eventually go back and revisit the other chains from the former base
chain's call stack.

It's a bit like my goto misunderstanding... totally obvious to a
netfilter developer, but maybe not so for a starter.

Again, if one already knows how it works - it's clear, sure.

But if not, one could e.g. also think that evaluation continues only
for the side effects (e.g. counters).

Well... I don't know whether the majority of beginners would
immediately grasp this or not.

I, personally, like it always more of teaching is rather done extra
elaborative... but that's of course just one approach.

What about the following:

I'll make a v3 now, *with* the changes as proposed before, and you
simply redact things where you'd rather have them differently?
Otherwise we just continue to haggle on the wording ;-)

I'll be fine with whatever you choose. :-)

Well, compared to a pure beginner,... how much more parts of netfilter
have been implemented by *you*? ;-)

Don't forget... this *is* clear once you know how it works, but if you
start from scratch... the pure meaning of the word "accept" would IMO
rather imply: "let the packet through (ultimately)".

Just as "drop" implies "into the torch with it (ultimately)" (which is
actually the case here).

I'd have two proposals now:
a) We leave:

> can itself not be overruled, while the various NAT statements may be

And add a sentence like:

nd not how

after it.
Though I personally would say that this is rather not of interest for
the evaluation summary chapter - only if it would make really a big
difference in terms of understanding how the evaluation effectively
works.

(Meanwhile I've already added a " as well as of all chains" after " the
current rule". I've also changed "*drop* verdicts" to singular as only
one could do the "overruling")

b) We change it to something like:
> For example, a *reject* also immediately terminates the evaluation of
> the current rule as well as of all chains, prevents any previous
> *accept* from other chains to decide the ultimate fate of the packet
> and cannot be turned into an *accept*, while the various NAT

> *drop* verdict respectively statements that imply this are issued.

But TBH, I think (b) is ugly and rather difficult to understand... and
merely tries to avoid overruling/overriding/etc. at all costs.


Again, I can make another round after you decide... but feel free to
simply edit v3 as you wish. :-)

I'd have changed it now to:

Feel free to change it, and also to replace "actions" with a better
word if you have one.

I think that would definitely make sense (then we could also simply let
the above "Note" sentence refer to that).

I mean such a document should then probably also describe the hooks,
what they're intended for and in general some concepts how the whole
networking thingy actually works (i.e. what happens from the arrival of
the packet until it reaches some application and the other way round).

Perhaps also elaborating a bit on concepts like NAT, forwarding, etc.
... which easily makes such a manpage quite some effort and go beyond
netfilter into general networking.


Though I think what would be even nicer would be some generic
"teaching" on writing nftables rules... I've mentioned some examples
before.

E.g. I've been trying to implement the strong host model via:
  fib daddr . iif type !=3D {local, broadcast, multicast} drop

which nft(8) places in prerouting but some examples on the net in input
I guess I might understand the difference ^^ ... but I tried to
actually verify whether it does what it should (via some qemu VM with
multiple ifaces and nping), but failed.


And in particular also with respect to writing "performant" rules,
e.g.:
- I've seen many examples, where the rules for actually accepting new
  connections (like SSH, http, whatever) do things like these:
 =20
  in iptables, they often used --syn, which iptables-translate would
  translate, but - assuming the conntrack state is always readily
  available - I guess it's better (and equally fast if not faster) to
  use ct state new.

  But even then, many people do things like:
        ct state established,related accept
        ct state invalid drop
        meta iif lo accept

  In that light, does it even make sense to match on ct state new
  later?

  Perhaps also telling whther it makes sense to have the
        ct state established,related accept
  rule first, (assuming most packets will already be handled by it).
  I've seen quite some examples which accept the loopback first, but -
  under my above assumption - would also guess that having the
  established rule first should be at least equally fast.

- Teaching people a bit about how ordering of statements should be done
  within one rule.
  Consider something like:
     ct state new iifname eth0 tcp dport ssh accept
  would e.g.:
     ct state new tcp dport ssh iifname eth0 accept
  be faster?

  Perhaps also telling a bit about: which information is already
  available and which requires further parsing when the statement is
  encoutnered, e.g. if tcp dport is encountered, does that first need
  to be extracted form the packet, or is that already done?

  Similarly, is it better to first match on ip [ds]addr and then on
  (tcp|udp) [ds]port or vice versa... or no difference or is it
  dependent on what one matches on?

- Perhaps also on: when should one start to split things up in chains?
  Consider e.g.:
     ct state new tcp dport ssh accept
     ct state new tcp dport http accept
     ct state new tcp dport https accept
     ct state new udp dport domain accept

  For each packet, ct state new would be checked again, so when does it
  make sense (i.e. when is the jump/goto/return cheaper) to do:
     ct state new jump new-packets
  and evaluate tcp/udp dports there?

  Similarly, a UDP packet would be evaluated against all rules (even
  with a new-packets chain)... so roughly when does it make sense to
  make yet another sub chain for tcp and one for udp?

- I've also seen a great many of "base rule sets" for workstations...
  like what which ICMPv[46] to let through, etc. ... all slightly
  different.
  Of course this may again be beyond the scope of nftables/netfilter
  and rather go into general teaching of networking.


I mean all this probably doesn't matter on some workstation, but at the
university I work we run a storage element for LHC with many PiB data
and more or less constant high volume network,... there these things
might matter?

Well, it's kind of the anti-particle to drop, which does just that
fast-forwarding (except into the void).

> This isn't the case even in old ipchains.

I guess that quite some users never ever touched chains other than
INPUT and OUTPUT,... so from their PoV, -j ACCEPT might have been kinda
like that.

It already is:

which may be considered a bit fuzzy again, cause it mentions that rule
traversal is ended (which could be considered to mean only with respect
to the current base chain)... and doesn't mention that it also
"ignores" any further statements in the current rule.

I've added another commit on top, which takes care of this.

Would you mind just dropping/editing the controversial stuff as you
seems it fits? :-)

Especially since I've kinda lost track which parts of it are now
exactly still controversial and which not (I guess mostly the *accept*
documentation now?) ^^


Thanks,
Chris.
