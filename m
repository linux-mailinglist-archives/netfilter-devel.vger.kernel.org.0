I decided against it.
Why adding a warning?  We do not change what the rule does, and we do
not collapse different rules into one.

I think it could be done on a case-by-case basis.

nft add rule ip filter input ip protocol tcp tcp dport 22
-> tcp dport 22

nft add rule inet filter input tcp dport 22 tcp sport 55
-> tcp sport 55 tcp dport 22

I don't think there is any point in warning about this, so
why warn about tcp dport { 22 } ?

A warning should, IMO, be reserved for something where we
detect a actual problem, e.g.

tcp dport 22 tcp dport 55

and then we could print a 'will never match' warning for nft -f,
and maybe even refuse it for "nft add rule .."

Full ruleset optimization should, IMO, be done transparently as
well if we're confident such transformations are done correctly.

I would however only do it for nft -f, not for "nft add rule ..."

I see rulesets appearing that are very iptables like, e.g.

tcp dport 22 accept
tcp dport 80 accept

and so on, and I think it makes sense to allow nft to compact this.
We could  add optimization level support to nft, i.e.  only do basic
per-rule and do cross-rule optimizations only with a command line parameter.

I think a trivial one such as s/{ 22 }/22/ should just be done automatically.
