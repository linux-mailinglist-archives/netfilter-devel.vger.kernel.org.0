Hi Pablo,

I always find that somewhat sad, as with HTTP there is no real convenient
way to get directory listings in a standardized / parseable format.  But
of course I understand the rationale and I obviously respect your
decision in that matter.

Maybe make http://ftp.netfilter.org/ an alias to it?

I think the important part would be some way to conveniently obtain a
full clone, e.g. by rsync.  This way both public and private mirrors
can exist in an efficient way, without having to resort to 'wget -r'
or related hacks, which then only use file size as an indication if a
file might have changed, ...

Regards,
	Harald
