I started a patch, spent several hours in a row, but I need more time
to get this right.

There is also Phil making the line to remove this in nf-next.

I can see veth hits synchronize_rcu(), this can be called from
default_device_exit_batch() which calls unregister_netdevice_many().

I need time, but it is difficult. We have to deliver a pull request
very late on wednesday so it can be taken on thursday.

Now the week has three days to fix and test stuff, so upstream
maintainers have a day to tidy up and submit upstream.

Yes, I can follow up in -next, but then Phil just remove this again in
-next.

I can just take this fix to address the existing situation which is
worse than before. Before this patch UAF was possible, although I
never manage to trigger it. Now crash is easy to trigger, I spent too
much time looking at the interaction with layers and I forgot basic
assumption regarding nf_tables in this patch.
