No need for kernel code update.

My proposal is to add NFTNL_EXPR_LOOKUP_SET_PTR, that allows you to
pass a pointer to the set, if that makes this simpler for you.

This would be an alias of the SET_ID, from the build path it would
use. You would still need to add the set command.

But I think you will end up needing the set cache anyway from the
netlink dump path anyway.

I'm re-evaluating, and I think your patchset is a good approach.
