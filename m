The behaviour is consistent.  Once flow is offloaded, ruleset is
bypassed.  Its easy to not offload those flows that need the ruleset.

56 lines of code *now*.

Next someone wants to call into sets/maps for named counters that
they need.  Then someone wants limit or quota to work.  Then they want fib
for RPF.  Then xfrm policy matching to augment acccounting.
This will go on until we get to the point where removing "fast" path
turns into a performance optimization.

Existing rule hw offload via netdev:ingress makes it clear
what rules are offloaded and to which device and it augments
flowtable feature regardless if thats handled by software fastpath,
software fallback/slowpath or by hardware offload.

I don't understand why this would have to occur after nat, but
netdev:egress exists as well.
