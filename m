It's the opposite: Things are working fine even after my
simplifications. get_set_interval_find() expected left/right values
which sit within a range, e.g. left/right of 22/23 and a set with
element 20-30. But to my surprise, this doesn't happen. With these
example values, left/right are 20/30, i.e. match the range in the set.

That's why I extended tests/shell/testcases/sets/0034get_element_0.
Please have a look if there's a use-case I missed.

Cheers, Phil
