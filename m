It seems to me that mini-gmp.c was designed to be used like we do.

For the linenoise case, given that there's already a package in
Fedora, I'm fine to go for AC_CHECK_LIB([linenoise], ...) and _not_
including the copy in our tree. Probably other distributions might
provide a package soon for this library.
