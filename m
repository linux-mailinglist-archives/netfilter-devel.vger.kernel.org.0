The RFC patch already resolves the issue despite having the code still run in softirq context. Even if estimators were processed in groups, moving the rate estimation out of softirq context is a good idea. I am interested in implementing this. An alternative approach would be moving the rate estimation out of softirq context and reworking locking so that cond_resched() could be used to let other processes run as the scheduler sees fit. I would be willing to try to implement this alternative approach as well.
