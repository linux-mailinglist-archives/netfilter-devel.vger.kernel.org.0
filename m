OK, I'll compare this to the sendmsg() call including several netlink
messages once you send your patch.

libmnl is preferred these days, specifically for advanced stuff.

I've been getting reports from users about this old API: It is simple
enough and people don't have to deal with netlink details to get
packets from the kernel for simple stuff.

Probably we should turn this deprecation into using libmnl and the
helpers that libnetfilter_queue provides is recommended. Or translate
this old API to use libmnl behind the curtain.
