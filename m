... I think this is too confusing and verbose.
packet ultimately passed: no drop verdict was issued.  Its all there is
to it, really.

This is fine.

Same.

Maybe rework the *accept* part to say that the packet moves on to the
next hook?  (As opposed to *drop*, which is final).

I think almost all of the overrule talk comes from this distinction (or
lack thereof).
