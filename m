Then, users will more than one single rule for different port-shift
mappings?

In my proposal, kernel would take the delta from register, the flag
tells the nat core how to interpret this.

This is an 'add' operation built-in into the NAT engine.

How would a generic 'add' operation in the kernel will work with
concatenations?
