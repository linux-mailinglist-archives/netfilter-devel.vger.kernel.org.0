Applied, thanks.

One thing that needs a fix (both libnetfilter_queue and libmnl).

If doxygen is not installed...

configure: WARNING: Doxygen not found - continuing without Doxygen support

it warns that it is missing...

checking that generated files are newer than configure... done

config.status: config.h is unchanged

libmnl configuration:
  doxygen:          yes

but it says yes here.

I'd prefer if documentation is not enabled by default, ie. users have
to explicitly specify --with-doxygen=yes to build documentation, so
users explicitly picks what they needs.

Please, follow up with a few patches, thanks.
