Hi Phil,

OK, so NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS contains the xt expressions.

Then, _ACTUAL_EXPR is taken if kernel supports it and these are
expressions that run from datapath, if present.

It is indeed.

So this is not swapping things, right? Probably I am still getting
confused but the initial approach described in A.

When, dumping back to userspace, NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS still stores
the xt compat representation and NFTA_RULE_ACTUAL_EXPRS the one that
runs from kernel datapath (if the kernel supports this attribute).

Old kernels would simply discard the ACTUAL_ attribute. Maybe _ALT_
standing by alternative is a better name?

Sorry, this is a bit confusing but I understand something like this is
required as you explained during the NFWS.
