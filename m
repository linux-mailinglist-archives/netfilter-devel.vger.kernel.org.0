That's  really bad. Still, I think it was a bug earlier which was 
then fixed. The logic could be changed in the user rules from

iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set c src --bytes-gt 800 -j DROP

to

iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set c src --bytes-lt 800 -j ACCEPT
[ otherwise DROP ]

but of course it might be not so simple, depending on how the rules are 
built up.

I almost added to my previous mail that the 'ge' and 'gt' matches are not 
really useful at the moment...

The other possibility is to force counter update. I.e. instead of

iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set c src --bytes-gt 800 -j DROP

something like

iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set c src --update-counters \
	--bytes-gt 800 -j DROP

but that also requires some internal changes to store a new flag, because 
at the moment only "! --update-counters" is supported. So there'd be then 
a fine-grained control over how the counters are updated:

- no --update-counters flag: update counters only if the whole rule 
  matches, including the counter matches
- --update-counters flag: update counters if counter matching is false
- ! --update-counters flag: don't update counters

Best regards,
