INVALID packets are those that netfilter has no idea what to do with and will eventually drop them after they fit no existing ACCEPT rules. A couple examples of INVALID packets would be (1) a TCP RESET for a non-existent conn (possibly one that was just reset, possibly a DoS attack), and (2) a TCP data packet for a non-existent conn. Neither of these is routable because there is no place to send them. Thus they are dropped in due time. The choice is whether to drop them after they pass through all the rules they will pass through or to drop them as soon as possible after conntrack tags them as INVALID.

With iptables, I found the earliest I could drop bad traffic (large blocksets of addrs I never want access to or from whether or not they are INVALID, and all other INVALID packets) was at the top of PREROUTING in table mangle. I would think nftables is similar.

The most optimal involves the least amount of processing. I would think conntrack is more efficient at tagging INVALID packets than a bunch of rules somewhere. Then it takes only one rule to drop INVALID packets early in PREROUTING. Or two if you jump to a chain that has a DROP rule; said chain would allow you to easily add or remove a log rule.
