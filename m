Looks like a good approach! Better to return with an error (which almost
always won't happen) and let the user to refactor the code than to
allow ruleset to eat an unexpected amount of memory.

Or we can say that rule can contain not more than 4 combinations of
family and type.

BTW, 4 seems to be sufficient, at least for IP protocols.

Agreed
