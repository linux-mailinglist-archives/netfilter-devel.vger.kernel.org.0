While this may be true for the vast majority of user space programs,
netfilter tools and libraries are a bit special in how close they
interface with the kernel. Not all netfilter-related kernel API is
exposed by glibc, for instance. Including (some) kernel headers is
therefore unavoidable, and (as your patch shows) order of inclusion
becomes subtly relevant in ways which won't show when compile-testing
against glibc only.

Ah, sorry! Patch subject and description managed to confuse me.

Pablo, what's your opinion? Maybe we should strive for the same solution
for the problem in all netfilter user space, so either take what we have
in iptables or adjust iptables to what nftables decides how things
should be?

Cheers, Phil
