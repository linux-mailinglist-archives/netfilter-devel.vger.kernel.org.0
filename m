Looks like the data structure contains garbage. Looking at ebtables
code, that seems likely as extension data structures are allocated using
malloc() and never set zero. init() function in ebt_nflog.c only
initializes prefix, group and threshold fields (which seem to be set
correctly in your MIPS dump).

I wonder how this is supposed to work, I can't find a place which zeroes
relevant data. It looks like we're missing memset() calls in
ebt_register_{match,watcher,target} functions. OTOH this seems to work
fine in most cases, so I'm likely missing something.

Cheers, Phil
