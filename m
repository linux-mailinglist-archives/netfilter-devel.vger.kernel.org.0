I see, maybe pktb_build_data() can be extended to take the "extra"
arg. Or something like this:

 void pktb_build_data(struct pkt_buff *pktb, uint8_t *payload, uint32_t size, uint32_t len)

where size is the total buffer size, and len is the number of bytes
that are in used in the buffer.

With this patchset, the user is in control of the data buffer memory
area that is attached to the pkt_buff head, so you can just allocate
the as many extra byte as you require.

I think it's fine if pktb_mangle() deals with this data buffer
reallocation in case it needs to expand the packet, a extra patch on
top of this should be fine.

Thanks for explaining.
