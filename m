If you're going to reference offline/off-list discussions in a post to
a public list, perhaps the original discussion shouldn't have been
off-list ;)  If you don't involve us in the discussion, we have to
waste a lot of time getting caught up.

That's a question for the people who track these certification
requirements, which is thankfully not me at the moment.  Unless
somebody else wants to speak up, Steve Grubb is probably the only
person who tracks that sort of stuff and comments here.

I believe the netfilter auditing was mostly a nice-to-have bit of
functionality to help add to the completeness of the audit logs, but I
could very easily be mistaken.  Richard put together those patches, he
can probably provide the background/motivation for the effort.

Patches are always welcome, but it might be wise to get to the bottom
of the certification requirements first.
