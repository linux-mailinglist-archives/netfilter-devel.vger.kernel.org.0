If the NFT_META_TIME_* names are off, then those for the
frontend are too.

I think
meta time <iso-date>
meta hour <relative to this day>
meta day <weekday>

are fine, and thus so are the uapi enums.

Examples:

meta time < "2019-06-06 17:20:20" drop
meta hour 11:00-17:00 accept
meta day "Sat" drop

What would you suggest as alternatives?
