Hi Jeremy,

Thanks for working on this.

Could you squash a few of these patches to get a smaller patchset?

My suggestions:

* Squash 01/30, 02/30 and 03/30, call this something like: "netfilter: add
  missing include guard". Just document that the chunk for the
  flowtable is fixing up a comment.

* For 04/30, since this is about SPDX, I would suggest you leave this
  behind and we wait for someone to make a whole pass over the netfilter
  headers to check for missing SPDX tags? Not a deal breaker, you can
  keep it in this batch if you like.

* Squash 05/30, 06/30 and 07/30, call this I'd suggest: "netfilter:
  fix coding style errors", document the stray semi-colons, the
  Kconfig missing indent and the trailing whitespaces.

* Squash 09/30, 10/30, 11/30, 12/30 and 12/30. They all refer to
  #include updates, could you squash and document these updates?

* 14/30, "netfilter: remove superfluous header" I'd suggest you rename
  this to "netfilter: remove nf_conntrack_icmpv6.h header".

* 15/30 and 16/30 LGTM.

* 17/30 I don't think struct nf_bridge_frag_data qualifies for the
  global netfilter.h header.

* 19/30 LGTM.

* With 20/30 gets more ifdef pollution to optimize a case where kernel
  is compiled without this trackers. I would prefer you keep this
  back.

* Please, squash 21/30 and 22/30.

* 24/30 nft_set_pktinfo_ipv6_validate() definition already
  deals with this in the right way.

* 25/30 nf_conntrack_zones_common.h only makes sense if NF_CONNTRACK
  is enabled, I don't understand.

* 27/30 identation is not correct, not using tabs.

* 26/30 is adding more #ifdef CONFIG_NETFILTER to the netfilter.h
  header. They make sense to make this new infra to compile headers,
  but from developer perspective is confusing.

* 30/30 very similar to 26/30...

--- a/include/linux/netfilter/ipset/ip_set.h

Shouldn't probably the CONFIG_HEADER_TEST infrastructure check if the
Kconfig option is set on before blindy compiling headers?
