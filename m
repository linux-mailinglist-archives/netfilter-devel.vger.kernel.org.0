I mean, keep per cpu counters for addition and deletions. Then, when
dumping you could collected them and provide the number.

We used to have these stats for conntrack in:

/proc/net/stat/nf_conntrack

but they were removed, see 'insert' and 'delete', they never get
updated anymore. conntrack is using atomic for this: cnet->count, but
it is required for the upper cap (maximum number of entries).

Yes, with such a large number of entries, conntrack -L is not
convenient.
