Without any allowed port, yes. This test case is useful.

By tuning /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range (see
inet_csk_find_open_port call) we should be able to pick a specific
allowed port and test it.  We can also test for the EADDRINUSE error to
make sure error ordering is correct (compared with -EACCES).

However, I think the current LSM API don't enable to infer this random
port because the LSM hook is called before a port is picked.  If this is
correct, the best way to control port binding would be to always deny
binding on port zero/random (when restricting port binding, whatever
exception rules are in place). This explanation should be part of a
comment for this specific exception.

I think so but we need to make sure the random port cannot be < 1024, I
guess with /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range but I don't know for
IPv6.

Yes, but don't need to bind to anything (same for the next ones).

Yes, but without any binding.

Thinking more about this case, being able to add a rule with port zero
*for a connect action* looks legitimate.  A rule with both connect and
bind actions on port zero should then be denied.  We should fix
add_rule_net_service() and test that (with a first layer allowing port
zero, and a second without rule, for connect).

There is no need for any variant for the port_endianness test. You can
rename "inet" to "ipv4_tcp" (and not "inet_tcp" like I said before).
