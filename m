nftables transactions are atomic, either the entire batch takes effect or not
at all.

The audit_log_nfcfg() calls got added to the the nft monitor infra which
is designed to allow userspace to follow the entire content of the
transaction log.

So, if its just a 'something was changed' event that is needed all of
them can be removed. ATM the audit_log_nfcfg() looks like this:

        /* step 3. Start new generation, rules_gen_X now in use. */
        net->nft.gencursor = nft_gencursor_next(net);

        list_for_each_entry_safe(trans, next, &net->nft.commit_list, list) {
                switch (trans->msg_type) {
                case NFT_MSG_NEWTABLE:
			audit_log_nfcfg();
			...
		case NFT_MSG_...
			audit_log_nfcfg();
	..
	       	}

which gives an audit_log for every single change in the batch.

So, if just a summary is needed a single audit_log_nfcfg()
after 'step 3' and outside of the list_for_each_entry_safe() is all
that is needed.

If a summary is wanted as well one could fe. count the number of
transaction types in the batch, e.g. table adds, chain adds, rule
adds etc. and then log a summary count instead.
