I think the author of 1bf2ac490d28c is using it for a testing tool
that sends very small batches (only few commands at a time). In that
case, considering the default socket buffer size, the acknowledment is
going to fit into the userspace netlink socket buffer.

In netlink, ENOBUFS is not "fatal", it means messages got lost, but
there are still messages in the netlink socket buffer to be processed,
ie. the netlink messages before the overrun are still in place, but
the messages that could not fit in into the socket buffer has been
dropped.

nfnetlink handles a batch in two stages:

1) Process every netlink message in the batch, if either netlink
   message triggers an error or NLM_F_ACK is set on, then enqueue
   an error to the list.

2) If batch was successfully processed, iterate over the list of
   errors and create the netlink acknowledgement messages that is
   stores in the userspace netlink socket buffer.

Since this is a batch of netlink messages, acknowledgement either
triggered by explicit NLM_F_ACK or by errors may overrun the netlink
socket buffer.

EPERM is indeed fatal.

I think I see your point.

Acknowledgement for _BEGIN will be likely in the netlink socket
buffer, because it is the first message to be acknowledged, but _END
is the last one to be processed, so it could get lost if many
acknowledgements before have been queued to the userspace netlink
socket buffer (leading to overrun).

It seems with 1bf2ac490d28c, an acknowledgement with _BEGIN can be an
indication of successfully handling a batch in the way you describe.

For this nfnetlink batching, use select() to poll for pending messages
to process, and make no assumptions on how many messages you receive.

If you open, send then batch, process response, then close. Lazy
approach that consist of bailing out on the first error is OK. The
close call on the socket implicitly cleans up the ignored pending
error messages in the socket buffer.

But if you keep the socket open for several batches, with the approach
you describe, then unprocessed netlink error messages will pile up on
the socket buffer. If you do not do any sort of sequence tracking,
then you application process old pending errors as new, libmnl handles
this with EILSEQ.

All these netlink subtle details are not easy to follow :).

As for netlink batching, which is supported in other classic netlink
subsystems, this acknowledgement overrun issue exists, I am referring
to the scenario where you add several netlink messages to the buffer
and send() them to the kernel.

As for nfnetlink, it is a bit special in that it has begin and end
messages because this is needed for the transaction semantics (to
implement a dryrun to test if incremental ruleset update is OK).

1bf2ac490d28c added the handling for NLM_F_ACK which I left it
unspecified at the time.

Netlink can be also used for event delivery to userspace, ENOBUFS can
also happen in that case, but that is a different scenario.

TBH, I am trying to remember the details, I don't talk about Netlink
very often.
