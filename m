I'd suggest that you place your patch 2/7 to modify the existing
behaviour in first place.

Currently, NFTA_HOOK_DEVS already represents the netdevice that are
active. If one of these devices goes aways, then it is removed from
the basechain and it does not show up in NFTA_HOOK_DEVS anymore.

There are netlink notifications that need to fit into NLMSG_GOODSIZE,
but this adds yet another netlink array attribute.

I think we cannot escape adding new commands such as:

NFT_MSG_NEWDEVICE
NFT_MSG_GETDEVICE
NFT_MSG_DELDEVICE

to populate the basechain/flowtable, those can be used only if the
"subscription" mecanism is used, so older kernels still rely in
NFTA_HOOK_DEVS (older-older kernels actually already deal with
NFTA_HOOK_DEV only...).

NFT_MSG_NEWDEVICE can provide a flag to specify this is a wildcard
or exact matching.

There is also a need for a netlink attribute to specify if this is
adding a device to a chain or flowtable.

With these new commands, the NFT_NETDEVICE_MAX cap can also go away in
newer kernels with a command like this:

        nft add device flowtable ip x y { a, b, c }
        nft add device chain ip x y { a, b, c }

which expands to one one NFT_MSG_* message for each item.

Then, the nested notation will need to detect what to use depending on
the user input:

        table netdev x {
                chain y {
                        type filter hook ingress devices = { tap* } priority 0
                }
        }

this triggers the new commands path, same if the list of devices goes
over NFT_NETDEVICE_MAX (256).

This can also help incrementally report on new devices that match on a
given "subscription pattern" via new NFT_MSG_NEWDEVICE command for
monitoring purpose.

Maybe a command like:

        nft list device chain ip x y

could be used to list the existing devices that are "active" as per
your definition, so:

        nft list ruleset

does not show the listing of "active" devices that expand to tap*,
because this is only informational (not really required to restore a
ruleset), I guess the user only wants this to inspect to make sure
what devices are registered to the given tap* pattern.

There is also another case that would need to be handled:

        - chain A with device tap0
        - chain B with wildcard device tap*

I would expect a "exclude" clause for the wildcard case will come
sooner or later to define a different policy for a specify chain.
The new specific command approach would be extensible in that sense.

I think this series is all about this wildcard interface matching,
which is not coming explicitly.
