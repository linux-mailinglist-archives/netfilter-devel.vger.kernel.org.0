Sure, but then we're talking about e.g. bug in dns resolver/parser
or something like that.

In general I don't believe Linux is capable of isolating against
abusing userspace, unfortunately.  Especially with CAP_NET_ADMIN
(which is very broad and provides access to many facilities in
 the kernel) or with unprivilged user namespaces enabled (the default,
sigh).

In that case I think all bets are of.

Ok, if you want then feel free to start to send patches.
(and CC Jan).

I think that enabling CAP_NET_ADMIN restriction is fine,
otoh if you think that this should be done then I believe
its better to patch nft and not rely on systemd for this.
