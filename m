Appending another "dot digit" is not uncommon in other projects, so I
guess most parsers should get it right.

I did not mean for 0.9.10 to be 0.9.8 + fixes, but 0.9.9 + only fixes.
So not skip, but include.

Skimming the list, I think there's not too much in there which is not a
fix. While there are only 20 commits having a Fixes: tag, there's the
parser keyword scoping and some cache rework also. In other words,
requiring downstream to update to 0.9.9 from 0.9.8 in order to benefit
from upstream's blessed 0.9-stable release might be acceptable.

Fine with me, too.
