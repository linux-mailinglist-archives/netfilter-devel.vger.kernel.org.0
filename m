Those counters are used to print the number of affected entries for
each command "type" executed.
I.e. prior to the "--load-file" support it was only possible to have a
single command for each conntrack tool invocation,
so a global counter used to print the stats message like
"conntrack v1.4.6 (conntrack-tools): 1 flow entries have been created."
was sufficient.

With the --load-file/-R command support it is possible to have
multiple command types
in a single conntrack tool invocation, e.g. both -I and -D commands as
in example below.

echo "-D -w 123
-I -w 123 -s 1.1.1.1 -d 2.2.2.2 -p tcp --sport 10 --dport 20 --state
LISTEN -u SEEN_REPLY -t 50 " | conntrack -R -

The per-command counters functionality added here makes it possible to print
those stats info for each command "type" separately.
So as a result of the above command something the following would be printed:

conntrack v1.4.6 (conntrack-tools): 1 flow entries have been created.
conntrack v1.4.6 (conntrack-tools): 3 flow entries have been deleted.

Following your request to make the changes more granular, I moved this
functionality
to this separate "preparation" commit.

Are you talking about error handling processing ct_cmd entries?
The way it is done currently is that each failure would result in
exit_error to happen.
This logic actually stays unchanged.

Thanks, I'll have a look into them.
