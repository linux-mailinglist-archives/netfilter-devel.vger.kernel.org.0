I running this comparison between 1.0.1:

# nft -v
nftables v1.0.1 (Fearless Fosdick #3)
# nft -f dump_sep.nft

real    0m3,867s
user    0m3,651s
sys     0m0,219s

and current 1.0.4 plus pending patches in patchwork:

# nft -v
nftables v1.0.4 (Lester Gooch #3)
# nft -f dump_sep.nft

real    0m3,867s
user    0m3,677s
sys     0m0,190s

For the record, this dump_sep.nft (that you sent me) looks like this:

# cat dump_sep.nft
add table t
add set t s { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
add element t s { 1.0.1.0/24 }
add element t s { 1.0.2.0/23 }
[...] more single command to add element [...]

Then, this needs to coalesce the commands that update a single set at
a later stage, in such commit preparation phase.

This code also has to deal with deletions coming in the same batch,
which might be happening per command, by a robot generated batch.

Userspace overlap detection is only required by kernels <= 5.7, so
this check could be removed.

For automerging, I don't think I can escape tracking each command to
update the userspace set cache and adjust the existing ranges
accordingly.
