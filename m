series LGTM.

A few more nits:

# cat test.nft
add table netdev x
add chain netdev x y
add rule netdev x y ip saddr 1.2.3.4 vlan id 10
# nft -f test.nft
test.nft:3:38-44: Error: conflicting protocols specified: ether vs. vlan
add rule netdev x y ip saddr 1.2.3.4 vlan id 10
                                     ^^^^^^^

it also occurs here:

# cat test.nft
add table netdev x
add chain netdev x y
add set netdev x macset { typeof ip saddr . vlan id; flags dynamic,timeout; }
add rule netdev x y update @macset { ip saddr . vlan id }
# nft -f test.nft
test.nft:4:49-55: Error: conflicting protocols specified: ether vs. vlan
add rule netdev x y update @macset { ip saddr . vlan id }
                                                ^^^^^^^

This is related to an implicit ether dependency.

If you see a way to fix this incrementally, I'm fine with you pushing
out this series and then you follow up.

Another issue: probably it would make sense to bail out when trying to
use 'vlan id' (and any other vlan fields) from ip/ip6/inet families?
vlan_do_receive() sets skb->dev to the vlan device, and the vlan
fields in the skbuff are cleared. In iptables, there is not vlan match
for this reason.
