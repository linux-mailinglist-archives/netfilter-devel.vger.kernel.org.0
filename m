I wish you would have reported this before you started to work on
this, because this is not a bug, this is expected behaviour.

Once you offload, the ruleset is bypassed, this is by design.
Lets not make the software offload more complex as it already is.

If you want to apply dscp payload modification, do not use flowtable
offload or hook those parts at netdev:ingress, it will be called before the
software offload pipeline.

I will reply to some of the changes to the shell tests because this
general reply above doesn't apply to those patches.
