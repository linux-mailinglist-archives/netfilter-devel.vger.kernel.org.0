Note that you can specify:

  list hooks ip device enp0s25

this shows the hooks that will be exercised for a given packet family,
ie. IPv4 packets will exercise the following hooks.

family ip {
        hook ingress {
                 0000000000 chain netdev x y [nf_tables]
        }
        hook prerouting {
                -0000000400 ipv4_conntrack_defrag [nf_defrag_ipv4]
                -0000000200 ipv4_conntrack_in [nf_conntrack]
        }
        hook input {
                 0000000000 chain ip filter in [nf_tables]
                +2147483647 nf_confirm [nf_conntrack]
        }
        hook forward {
                -0000000225 selinux_ip_forward
        }
        hook output {
                -0000000400 ipv4_conntrack_defrag [nf_defrag_ipv4]
                -0000000225 selinux_ip_output
                -0000000200 ipv4_conntrack_local [nf_conntrack]
        }
        hook postrouting {
                +0000000225 selinux_ip_postroute
                +2147483647 nf_confirm [nf_conntrack]
        }
}

This is _not_ showing the list of hooks for a given family.

What I meant is that user could filter out by ingress and egress
device to fetch the hooks that are traversed in such case, ie.

  list hooks ip iifname eth0 oifname eth1

to get the traversal of hooks for IPv4 packets, assuming eth0 as
ingress device and eth1 as egress device.

Makes sense, it currently fails with EINVAL because no device has been
specified.

OK
