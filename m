I would keep both with current semantics, i.e. 'break'/no match until we
get more evidence that we need this ARPHDR_VOID store.

For iifkind, I am not sure.  Perhaps leave it as-is?

Kernel doesn't allow "" iifname (so we can reuse it for 'no interface'),
but what about ifkind?

I think we should leave userspace alone.
