OK. sorry, NFT_SET_ANONYMOUS is misleading, this anonymous flag means
'set is bound to rule', it was wrong to choose this flag name,
probably NFT_SET_BOUND would be better. Anyway, I was referring to
meter with no name.

Oh, we already deprecated meters with no name :-)

And meters with a name should not be used, there's a better syntax
now for this rather than this sloppy way to create an object from the
rule itself without an explicit definition.

No, I mean there is no NFT_SET_EXT_EXPR handling yet, sorry I forgot
the _EXT_ infix.

nft_lookup should invoke the expression that is attached. Control
plane code is also missing, there is no way to create the
NFT_SET_EXT_EXPR from newsetelem() in nf_tables_api.c.

If NFT_SET_EVAL is set or not from nft_lookup is completely
irrelevant, nft_lookup should not care about this flag.

Agreed.
