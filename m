One can make lots of arguments for both sides.

* You cannot mix certain commands. This for example cannot be
  converted to use .B syntax as far as my understanding of roff
  syntax goes:

	.TP
	Some \fBbold\fP keyword
	Explanation what they keyword does

	.TP
	Some
	.B bold
	keyword but oops we are already in the explanation

* Desire for consistent markup across entire documentation;
  since we cannot use .B reliably, \fB offered to take the
  place and so almost all the mantext in iptables uses \fB.

* .B (and commands like it) bloat the line count if you have a lot of
  words to markup, and we certainly do in e.g. the "Synopsis"
  sections.

* \(en could be changed to \[en] or to the Unicode character
  directly. But the groff manpage has ample warnings:

  """these groff extensions are presented using its special character
  form \[]"""

  """Some of these code points are used by groff for internal
  purposes, which is one reason it does not support UTF‐8
  natively."""

  I need to revise the \[-] patch perhaps based on what I just
  learned.

That said, it's 2023. People _should_ be having a syntax-highlighting
editor, and I don't mean it needs to have fancy colors. Just set
escape codes apart (brighten or dimming, whichever is your thing),
e.g. https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/b593dd7ee4db .
