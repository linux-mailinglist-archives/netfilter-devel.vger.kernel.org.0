I do see your point about avoiding invalid configurations, but, well XDP
is already very much a "use it right or it will break on you" kind of
thing, so I think that bit is kinda unavoidable. As in, upon loading the
XDP program that does the lookup, you can validate the configuration and
reject loading if it's setup in a way that your program can support.
Whereas if you have to set a flag on the flowtable itself, that means
you have to make changes to the nft ruleset itself to be compatible with
XDP acceleration (right?), you can't just go "accelerate my existing
ruleset".

Well, I am kinda assuming that userspace is the entity doing the
removing, in which case it should already know this, right? I must admit
to being a little fuzzy on the details of when a flowtable object is
replaced, though. For instance, does reloading an nft ruleset always
replace the flowtable with a new one (even if there's no change to the
flowtable config itself)?
