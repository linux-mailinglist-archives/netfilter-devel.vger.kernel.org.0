I was thinking about a case that the socket was created/bind/listen in
another process, then passed into the current process,

For example:
Process A has :
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE (family =3D f1, type =3D t1)
socket s1 is created in process A with family =3D f1, type =3D t1, and
bind/listen to port p1.

socket s1 is passed to process B
Process B has:
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE (family =3Df1, type =3D t2) (note the type
is different than A)
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_{CONNECT,BIND}_TCP (port =3D p2)

However, those rules in B don't restrict process B from using
accept(s1), s1 is another type.

In accept(2), struct sockaddr contains sa_family_t (AF_xx)  but no
type, which is strange to me, the API should either include both, or
none (accept whatever it is already in socket fd, which is set during
creation time).

looking into accept(2) implementation: it calls: sock->ops->accept
iiuc, sock->ops is set during socket(2), allowing each protocol to
have its own implementation.

When we consider a> our intention to restrict family + type of socket,
with b> socket can be passed between processes,
there can be a need to harden the check (family + type) for all of
bind/listen/accept/connect. Otherwise, there is still a possibility
that the process to accept a socket of different type unintentionally.

This means:
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_ATTR_CREATE (family =3Df1, type =3D t2)
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_ATTR_BIND (family =3Df1, type =3D t2)
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_ATTR_ACCEPT (family =3Df1, type =3D t2)
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_ATTR_ LISTEN (family =3Df1, type =3D t2)
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_ATTR_CONNECT (family =3Df1, type =3D t2)
Note: this checks family+type only, not port.
The check is applied to all protocols, so not specific to TCP/UDP

Performance is a valid concern.

As example of server, usually the main process listens/accepts incoming
connections, and forked processes do send/recv, the main process can
be viewed as a control plane, and send/recv can be viewed as a data
plane. It makes sense that we start with the control plane.

We might like to keep a note that by not restricting send/recv, a
socket can be created OOP, then passed into current process and call
send/recv, so the network is not fully disabled by landlock alone
(still need seccomp)

Things might get more complicated, say: a forked process is intended
to send/recv UDP, but was confused and got a TCP socket from
OOP, etc. This is not different than accept(2) case above. There might
be an opportunity for Landlock to harden this when we design for
data-plane.

I'm not sure if my view is fully explained. I don't mean to control
all kinds of socket bind/listen/connect actions.
My view is:
1> have a rule to check family + type, to make sure the process is
using the socket type they intend to use, such as
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_ATTR_{CREATE|CONNECT|BIND|ACCEPT|LISTEN}, as
discussed in accept(2) case.
2> have protocol specific rules, such as LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_{CONNECT,BIND}=
_TCP.
So bind(2) will be checked by both 1 and 2.

As example of TCP server, the process will use:
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_ATTR_{CREATE|BIND|ACCEPT|LISTEN}
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_{BIND}_TCP

I don't mean this to be _TCP specific, this is still the family + type
discussion above.
