Disassociation is basically about making socket be able to connect or
listen (again). If these actions are already controlled, disassociation
should always be permitted (as it's currently implemented for TCP
connect).

I thought that LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CONNECT_UNSPEC would be useful
for the protocols that do not have related LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_*
access rights. It would allow to (for example) create listening socket
of non-TCP(UDP) protocol and fully restrict networking (by restricting
any disassociation and socket creation).

But since disasossication is implemented in the transport layer there
is no clear way to control it with socket access. Considering this and
that previous scenario can be achieved by implementing networking
control (LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_* rights) for a needed protocol, potential
cost of "disassociation control" implementation is much more than the
benefits.
