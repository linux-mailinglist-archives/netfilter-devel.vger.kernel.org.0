You could define a ruleset that describes the policy following the
cgroupsv2 hierarchy. Something like this:

 table inet filter {
        map dict_cgroup_level_1 {
                type cgroupsv2 : verdict;
                elements = { "system.slice" : jump system_slice }
        }

        map dict_cgroup_level_2 {
                type cgroupsv2 : verdict;
                elements = { "system.slice/systemd-timesyncd.service" : jump systemd_timesyncd }
        }

        chain systemd_timesyncd {
                # systemd-timesyncd policy
        }

        chain system_slice {
                socket cgroupv2 level 2 vmap @dict_cgroup_level_2
                # policy for system.slice process
        }

        chain input {
                type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop;
                socket cgroupv2 level 1 vmap @dict_cgroup_level_1
        }
 }

The dictionaries per level allows you to mimic the cgroupsv2 tree
hierarchy

This allows you to attach a default policy for processes that belong
to the "system_slice" (at level 1). This might also be useful in case
that there is a process in the group "system_slice" which does not yet
have an explicit level 2 policy, so level 1 policy applies in such
case.

You might want to apply the level 1 policy before the level 2 policy
(ie. aggregate policies per level as you move searching for an exact
cgroup match), or instead you might prefer to search for an exact
match at level 2, otherwise backtrack to closest matching cgroupsv2
for this process.

There is also the jump and goto semantics for chains that can be
combined in this chain tree.

BTW, what nftables version are you using? My listing does not show
i-nodes, instead it shows the path.

 # nft list map inet filter dict_cgroup_level_1
 table inet x {
        map dict_cgroup_level_1 {
                type cgroupsv2 : verdict
                elements = { "system.slice" : jump system_slice }
        }
 }

Another side note: beware I'm setting the default policy to drop at
the 'input' chain in case you use this test ruleset. This is a
skeleton ruleset, more rules are likely needed to define what to do
with packets matching the described cgroupsv2.
