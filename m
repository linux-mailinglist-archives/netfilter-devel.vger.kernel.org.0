Thanks for compiling the patch. What I had in mind was to merge result
checks of failing rule with output mismatch, but I realize this would
likely turn into a mess.

A non-empty rule leading to empty output is a bug, IMHO.

The crucial detail here is that an expected output of "-j NFLOG" is
trivial and str::find() won't complain about extra output.

Given that we're discussing corner cases and what I had in mind has its
own downsides, I guess the status quo is fine at least for now. Sorry
for the fuss!

Cheers, Phil
