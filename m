I think I finally understand your reasoning. May I summarise it as the
following:

nftables chain forward having a flow add clause becomes a request from
the user to skip parts of Linux network stack. The affected flows will
become special and unaffected by most of the rules of the "slowpath"
chain forward. This is a sharp tool and user gets to keep both pieces
if something breaks :)

I agree that this is a well-defined and defensible position. I concur.

Yes, I really like that. Here is what such chain will do:

1. On the slow path it will behave identical to the forward chain.
2. The only processing done on fast_fwd fast path is interpretation
   of struct flow_offload_entry list (.
3. Such fast path is done between devices defined in flowtable f1
4. Apart from the interpretation of flow offload entries no other
   processing will be done.
5. (4) means that no Linux IP stack is involved in the forwarding.
6. However (4) allows concatenation of other flow_offload_entry
   producers (e.g. TC, ingress, egress nft chains).
7. flow_offload_entry lists may be connection dependent.
8. Similar to chain forward now, flow_offload_entry lists will be passed
   to devices for hardware acceleration.
9. IOW, flow_offload_entry lists become connection specific programs.
   Therefore such lists may be compiled to EBPF and accelerated on XDP.
10. flow_action_entry interpreters should be prepared to deal with IP
    fragments and other strangeness that ensues on our networks.

I don't fully understand the ONLY part, but do my points above address
this?

I think that due to point (8) above the potential for hardware
acceleration is higher. The hardware (e.g. switch) is free to pass
the packets between flowtable ports and not involve Linux stack at all.
It may do such forwarding because of the promise (4) above.

sets and maps are welcome in chain fast_fwd :) EBPF and XDP already have
them. Once (9) becomes reality we'll be able to suport them, somehow :)

I've incorporated XDP into my suggestion above. It seems to fit.

What do you think? Is going chain fast_fwd direction is feasible and
desirable?

Thanks,
Boris.
