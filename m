Segment routing is *not* just another protocol to carry encapsulated traffic
and, thus, to perform *only* encap/decap operations.

Directly quoting the abstract of the RFC 8986:
  ---
  The Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Network Programming framework
  enables a network operator or an application to specify a packet
  processing program by encoding a sequence of instructions in the IPv6
  packet header.

  Each instruction is implemented on one or several nodes in the
  network and identified by an SRv6 Segment Identifier in the packet.
  ---

In principle, each instruction can lead to a different processing than the
other.

This is the point: SRv6 End, End.T, End.X with their flavors are *not* encap/
decap operations. As SRv6 is not a protocol meant only for encap/decap, we
cannot apply to this the same logic found in other protocols that perform
encap/decap operations.

No, it does not work this way and this was an important design choice in the
SRv6 implementation in Linux. Basically, the SIDs corresponding to End
behaviors (srv6local) are *not* considered local addresses bound to a local
interface. This has important advantages in terms of the forwarding performance
of SRv6. We cannot change this design choice without causing a strong
performance impact on SRv6 forwarding.

No, this is a way to fix the problem that you introduce by changing the current
srv6local forwarding model. If you have 100 End SIDs should you add 100 accept
rules? The root problem is that SRv6 (srv6local) traffic should not go through
the INPUT path.

Have you set the traffic to flow through INPUT to confirm a connection (for
conntrack)? If this is the only reason, before changing the srv6local
processing model in such a disruptive way, you can investigate different ways
to do connection confirmation without going directly through nfhook with INPUT.
I can help with some hints if you are interested.

Andrea
