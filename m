There are currently two pending issues that, if addressed, could
improve things:

NLM_F_INTR is set on in case writer infers with a reader, currently
forcing userspace to read all of the remaining messages to leave
things in consistent state, otherwise next dump request hits EILSEQ in
libmnl. Before 6d085b22a8b5 ("table: support for the table owner
flag"), the socket was closed and reopen to workaround this issue.
There should be a way to discard the ongoing netlink dump without
having to read the remaining messages, that should also improve
things.

It should be possible to add generation counters per object type, so
userspace does not have to ditch all what it has in its cache, only
what it has changed. Currently the generation counter is global.
