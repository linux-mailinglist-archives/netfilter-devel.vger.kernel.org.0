Hi Phil,

Sorry for taking a while to catch up on this.

OK.

I think it would be good to skip these new NFTNL_SET_DESC_* attributes
since they are not used to pass a description to the kernel to help it
select the best set type. So, instead of nftnl_set_elem_snprintf_desc(),
it should be possible to add:

int nftnl_set_elem_snprintf2(char *buf, size_t size,
                             const struct nftnl_set *s,
                             const struct nftnl_set_elem *e,
                             uint32_t type, uint32_t flags)

(or pick a better name if you come up with any other alternative).

So the nftnl_set object provides the byteorder notation to display the
set element accordingly.

This requires an extra conversion from struct set to struct nftnl_set
for the debug case, that should be fine (--debug is slow path anyway).
If this needs to be speed up later on, it should be possible to keep
the nftnl_set object around as context.

Then, there is already NFTNL_UDATA_SET_KEYBYTEORDER and
NFTNL_UDATA_SET_DATABYTEORDER which store the byteorder for key and
data. I'm going to have a look at the userdata API since to see if I
can propose an easy API to set and to get userdata information (this
is currently a blob using TLVs that are stored in the kernel, but they
are not interpreted by the kernel, it's only useful context
information for userspace which is included in netlink dumps). This
should fill missing gap in my proposal.

Looking at your series, I think it's better it's better to avoid the
struct nftnl_set_desc definition that is exposed in the libnftnl
header, this will not allow for future extensions without breaking
binary compatibility. I understand your motivation is to avoid a
duplicated definition in the libnftnl and nftables codebase.
