So am I.

Looks like a variant of the same usecase.

So if basechains are not specified, then basechains policies are left
as is, but ruleset is flushed.

Semantics for this are: Flush out _everything_ (existing rules and
non-chains) but only leave existing basechain policies in place as is.

I wonder if this is intentional or a side effect of the --noflush support.

I'm Cc'ing Jozsef, maybe he remembers. Because you're reaching my
boundaries on the netfilter history for this one :-)
