Indeed. We could also differentiate socket(2) from accept(2) with a 
dedicated LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_ACCEPT right. This would enable to 
create a bind socket, sandbox the process and deny new socket(2) calls, 
but still allows to call accept(2) and receive new connections.

BTW, unix socket path opening should be considered too.

This is correct, except if the process receive a socket FD or open a 
unix socket path.
