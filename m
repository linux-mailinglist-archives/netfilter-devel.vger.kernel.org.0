There was a use-case in kube-proxy that we wanted to use comment to
store version/compatibility information so we could know whether it
has to recreate the whole table when upgrading to a new version due to
incompatible chain/rule changes (e.g. a chain's hook and priority is
changed). The reason why we wanted to avoid recreating the whole table
when it doesn't have to is because deleting the table would also
destory the dynamic sets in the table, losing some data.

Another minor reason is that the comments could be used to store
human-readable explanation for the objects. And they may be change when
the objects' functions change. It would be great if they could be
updated via the "add" operation, otherwise "delete+add" would always be
needed to keep comments up-to-date.

However, I don't know a use-case for back-to-back comment updates, I 
will check which one is more complex and risky: rejecting it or
supporting it.

As explained above, I think there is some value in supporting comment
update for other objects, especially when the objects contain dynamic
data. But I understand there are risks like you mentioned and it would
need to be more careful than tables. I would volunteer to take a try
for other objects, starting with objects similiar to tables first, if
it doesn’t sound bad to you. Please let me know if you feel it's not
worth.

Thanks,
Quan
