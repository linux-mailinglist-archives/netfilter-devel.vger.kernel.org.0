Reading Jozsefs email:

The locking prevents problems with concurrent resets,
but not concurrent modifcation with one (or more) resets.

Phil, what is the intention with the reset?
If the idea is to atomically reset AND list everything
(old values are shown) then yes, this approach doesn't work
either and something ipset-alike has to be done, i.e.
completely preventing any new transaction while a reset
"dump" is in progress.

Pablo, do you think we should combine this with the
ealier-discussed "perpetual dump restart" problem?

Userspace could request 'stable' dump that locks
out writers for the entire duration, and kernel could
force it automatically for resets.

I don't really like it though because misbehaving userspace
can lock out writers.
