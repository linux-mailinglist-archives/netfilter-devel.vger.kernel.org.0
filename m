I explored my approach further but ended up in an ugly situation due to
the use of 'set' keyword in rules: My code is not context-aware, so upon
recognizing 'set' keyword it switches to spec-condition. I can't simply
detect preceding command-keywords due to them being implicit in nested
notation.

My code worked with this after enabling detection of '{' in all
conditions and making it call BEGIN(0) (regardless of nspec value).

Maybe we could track nesting block depth in a simple counter?

We can't influence start conditions from within bison (if that's what
you had in mind). All we can do is try make flex aware of the current
input context. For instance, detect 'table' followed by '{' to open
"table definition context" and start tracking braces to detect its end.
Though after all I think your assessment of all this being "fragile" is
appropriate. :/

Cheers, Phil
