This patch fixes the failures around the index keyword. I see one more
issue around set entries.

Notably, if the set add and element add are on separate lines (and thus
round trips to the kernel) then the issue is not seen. Perhaps there are
more instances with other stateful objects.

--->8---

# cat /tmp/foo
add table inet foo
add set inet foo bar { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }; add element inet foo bar { 10.1.1.1/32 }
add element inet foo bar { 10.1.1.2/32 }

# nft -i < /tmp/foo
internal:0:0-0: Error: Could not process rule: File exists
