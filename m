Hi Maciej,

Did you test current code? I fixed quite a bunch of memleaks recently.
Did you capture iptables-restore input so we could build a reproducer?

Not explicitly, but maybe the following commits are worth a try:

432a5ecfa7890bd3495bb1ab5e34c2258090133f
b199aca80da5741add50cce244492cc005230b66

Not sure if they apply to your code-base, though.

Not to my knowledge. FWIW, I enhanced iptables/tests/shell for leak
checking, all iptables command calls exiting 0 properly free all memory
now. Of course this is not guaranteed to catch problems in
iptables-restore not exiting but reiterating over the same tables again
and again.

BTW: The commit you refer to fixes a problem where iptables would
incorrectly match a rule as equal although it's not. So without it, if
you have two rules which only differ in target payload (e.g., value of
MARK target), a rule delete command will always drop the first one found
no matter the target payload you passed. If you only delete by rule
number, you shouldn't need it.

Cheers, Phil
