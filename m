Either way is fine with me. See how I explicitly call 'echo "<input>" |
nft -f -' in xlate-test.py to force evaluation by the shell - an earlier
version of that code would break since nft saw the escapes. So *we*
don't need them, but one could argue it educates users that they'll have
to escape the quotes if they specify them on command line.
