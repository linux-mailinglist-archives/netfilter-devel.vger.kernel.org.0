Hi Duncan,

Not sure what default action you are referring to. If you are talking
about ulogd (hence NFLOG), as I said, I don't experience similar issue
with them. For the record, I tried to set `Storage=` in journald.conf
to volatile / none when I was using LOG. It didn't help avoiding the
high usage. (The usage doesn't reflect as systemd-journald's anyway.)
And I don't have any syslog installed.

Also, the CPU problem seems to be specific to low-end devices. The
"line" even seem to just draw between a raspberry pi 3 b+ and 4. So it
wouldn't surprise me if one cannot reproduce/notice it easily on some
"server server" or even just some old Nehalem desktop. By the way, I
tested with both a mainline aarch64 kernel build (5.4.6) and a
raspberrypi armv7 kernel build (4.19.88). The issue was reproducible
with either of them. (The distro was Arch Liunx ARM, if that matters.)

For the record, I am not writing because I "need to" use LOG and/or
log everything. I am writing just because I noticed the issue and felt
like I should report it. But thank you for you attention anyway.

Regards,
Tom
