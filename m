You are missing some meaning in what i said. I said it needed to be
split into two patchsets. A patchset is a collection of patches. I
would like to see one set of patches doing the merge, and a second set
of patches doing the case insensitive changes.

Within those patch sets, you should have lots of little patches, each
of which is simple to review, has a good commit messages, and it
obviously correct.

You are unlikely to get feedback saying the patches are too
small. There is however a limit of 15 patches in a patch set. If you
actually needed 20 patches, then you break it up into two patch sets.

Patches are human readable, especially when they are small, and have a
good commit message. Spend a little bit of time reading patches from
people like Russell King, Oleksij Rempel, just to pick two names at
random.

I use gitlab for the day job. It is missing some really basic features
which i think make it unsuitable for the Linux role of "Reviewer". It
also is really slow to use and does not scale to the volume of patches
you see on netdev. With some re-engineering, it might be possible to
fix these issues, but so far, i've not seen it happen.

Part of the issues here is, Linux is short of Maintainers/Reviews,
given the number of developers. So the processes are set up to make
the Maintainers/Reviews roles more efficient, pushing as much work as
possible to developers which there are plenty off. Tools like
gitlab/github don't really make the Maintainers/Reviews roles
efficient, so don't work too well for Linux.
