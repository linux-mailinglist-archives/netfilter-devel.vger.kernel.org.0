OK, so I had a close look at the code and played a bit with pahole. My
approach to avoiding the extra pointer is to add another set of types
which json_t embed. So taking json_array_t as an example:

| typedef struct {
|     json_t json;
|     size_t size;
|     size_t entries;
|     json_t **table;
| } json_array_t;

I could introduce json_location_array_t:

| typedef struct {
|     json_array_t array;
|     json_location_t *location;
| } json_location_array_t;

The above structs are opaque to users, they only know about json_t. So I
introduced a getter for the location data:

| int json_get_location(json_t *json, int *line, int *column,
|                       int *position, int *length);

In there, I have to map from json_t to the type in question. The problem
is to know whether I have a json_location_array_t or just a
json_array_t. The json_t may have been allocated by the input parser
with either JSON_STORE_LOCATION set or not or by json_array(). In order
to make the decision, I need at least a bit in well-known memory. Pahole
tells there's a 4byte hole in json_t, but it may be gone in 32bit builds
(and enlarging json_t is a no-go, they consider it ABI). The json_*_t
structures don't show any holes, and extending them means adding a
mandatory word due to buffering, so I may just as well store the
location pointer itself in them.

The only feasible alternative is to store location data separate from
the objects themselves, ideally in a hash table. This reduces the
overhead if not used by a failing hash table lookup in json_delete().

Cheers, Phil
