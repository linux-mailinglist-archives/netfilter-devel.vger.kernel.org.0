We are not Linux distributors, it's up to them to decide what they are
shipping in their packages, this debate is out of our scope. Assuming
that enabling this by default will not make them include this.

Most users rely on libmnl because they use some utility that pulls in
this dependency, most of them are not developers.

That's probably fine for you, but embedded developer will not be happy
with this dependency.

I'd really prefer to retain the existing default that has been in
place for many years.

It's also possible to provide up to date snapshots in the Netfilter
website to give it more visibility.

BTW, the autogenerated manpage differs quite a bit from standard
manpages in other existing packages? Do you know of any other software
following this approach of converting doxygen to manpage?

Thanks.
