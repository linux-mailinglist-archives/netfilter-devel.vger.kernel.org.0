Yes, that's the case. Being able to do so with for example 
"cgroupsv2name" would be nice.

That's possible and I'll probably make a PR for systemd for such a 
feature. But I don't think that's the best solution: if the NFT rules 
are loaded from initrd and systemd is not running (initrd is not built 
by dracut), rules won't work, even top level "system.slice" and 
"user.slice". Then network connectivity in initrd could be a problem. 
Also I don't know if that model would scale to unprivileged user 
services or containers. Userspace daemon feeding kernel information that 
it already knows seems a bit inelegant.
