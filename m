Hi there,

unfortunately the patch didn't work for me.

I did some deeper digging and it seems that nf_conntrack_find_get within 
ctnetlink_del_conntrack will not find the entry if the address family 
for the delete query is AF_UNSPEC (due to nfmsg->version being 0) but 
the conntrack entry was initially created with AF_INET as the address 
family. I believe the tuples will have different hashes in this case and 
my guess is that this is not accounted for in the code, i.e. that 
AF_UNSPEC should match both AF_INET and AF_INET6. At the moment it seems 
to match none instead.

I could be wrong though, I'm not that familiar with the netfilter code.

Regards,
   Felix
