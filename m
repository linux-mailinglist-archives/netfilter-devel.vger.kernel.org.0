Yes, because it is too large and you needed this visual aid.

We __rarely__ need to look at all these things at once.

I do not even remember when it was last time I needed to look into
these Makefiles, well now after this churning^H^H^H^H^H^H^H update :-)

Yes, it is as long as this email :-)

No, some .c files are really asking for split, and I have patches to
start doing so.

Yes, it is great, really.

But this is completely inconsistent with what we have in other existing
Netfilter trees.

No please, do not follow that path.

I have to run `make distcheck` to create tarballs, and I do not have
to wait to run all tests to do so.

Please do not couple tests with make process.
