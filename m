Your original suggestion was "Verify the sequence numbers of TCP packets 
strictly and do not change the timeout of the NAT mapping for an in-window 
RST packet." Please note, you should demonstrate that such a mitigation

- does not prevent (from conntrack point of view) currently
   handled/properly closed traffic to be handled with the mitigation as
   well
- the mitigation actually does not pose an easier exhaustion of the
   conntrack table, i.e. creating an easier DoS vulnerability against it.

The attack requires exhaustive port scanning. That can be prevented with 
proper firewall rules.

I find it really strange that those frameworks would match only the exact 
SEQ of the RST packets.
