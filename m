Applied up to 6/9.

Merge window will close soon and I'm going to be a bit defensive and
take only the batch that include the initial implementation. I would
prefer if we all use this round to start using the C implementation
upstream and report bugs. While I have received positive feedback from
other fellows meanwhile privately, this batch is large and I'm
inclined to follow this approach.

Please, don't be disappointed, and just follow up with more patches
once merge window opens up again.

Thanks.
