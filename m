Agree.

Note that in this series the on-demand part is still in place,
there will be no duplicate elements.

I can remove it, I don't think a full traversal (without doing
anything) will be too costly.

Yes, your patch gets rid of on-demand gc, I agree that we cannot
postpone full run in that case.

Yup.  I wanted to explore how much work this is, and it turns
out it gets a lot less ugly of we don't have to hande rbtree and
its end elements.

Nope, should not happen.

The GC will do lookup, will find the element, will
see its neither dead nor expired so it will be skipped.

At least thats the idea, entries get zapped only
if they are expired or dead (to handle packet path deletion).

Thanks!
