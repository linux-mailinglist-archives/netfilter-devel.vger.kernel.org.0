I meant checking family + type of socket, and apply to all of
socket(2),bind(2),accept(2),connect(2),listen(2), maybe
send(2)/recv(2) too.

s/LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE/LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_TYPE.

This implies the kernel will check on socket fd's property (family +
type) at those calls, this applies to
a - the socket fd is created within the process, after landlock is applied.
b - created in process prior to landlock is applied.
c - created out of process then passed into this process,
