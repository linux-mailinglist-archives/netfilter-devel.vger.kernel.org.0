Hello,

I try to send you the message again, it says it couldn't be send because=20
it was an HTML type message.


I use nftables for a development project with our company and I'm happy=20
with this application but I'm still learning a lot with all the options.

I'm using Debian environments (stretch and buster).

My problem is with the sets of nftables:
I use the sets to manage a large amount of ip addresses since it store=20
only the ipv4 addresses without any rules and process it much quicker.

So let's say I have this table configuration:

table ip test {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 set tmp {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 type ipv4_addr
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 }
}

I can add elements in my set without any problem, I can also delete them=20
one by one.

The problem I have is that I need to delete all the elements in the tmp=20
set and as precised in the manual of nftables I could flush the elements=20
of a set:

SETS
[...]
flush=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Remove all elements from the specified set.

But when I use the command to flush my sets, it doesn't work and=20
displays me an error message

nft 'flush set test tmp'
Error: Could not process rule: Invalid argument
flush set test tmp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So I used an other method that worked on version 0.7 by selecting all=20
the content of elements, but I updated to version 0.9.4 and can't make=20
it work since there is a new line each two addresses and I would rather=20
use a native command anyway.

I don't understand what I do wrong ? If you can please help me.

Regards,
