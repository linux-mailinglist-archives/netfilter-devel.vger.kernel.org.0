the problem is "-j LOG" at it's own and not suprisingly after having
enough of random crashes and kexec only spits the disk full of
demsg-output from iptables "-j LOG" switching awy to NFLOG and ulogd and
never ever faced antother crash

"-j LOG" spits into kernel ring buffer and by it's own produces double
load no matter what happns after the action
