Subject: [PATCH nf v2 0/4] nftables: Consistently report partial and entire set overlaps

Phil reports that inserting an element, that includes a concatenated
range colliding with an existing one, fails silently.

This is because so far set back-ends have no way to tell apart cases
of identical elements being inserted from clashing elements. On
insertion, the front-end would strip -EEXIST if NLM_F_EXCL is not
passed, so we return success to userspace while an error in fact
occurred.

As suggested by Pablo, allow back-ends to return -ENOTEMPTY in case
of partial overlaps, with patch 1/4. Then, with patches 2/4 to 4/4,
update nft_set_pipapo and nft_set_rbtree to report partial overlaps
using the new error code.

v2: Only consider active elements for rbtree overlap detection in
    patch 4/4 (Pablo Neira Ayuso)

Stefano Brivio (4):
  nf_tables: Allow set back-ends to report partial overlaps on insertion
  nft_set_pipapo: Separate partial and complete overlap cases on
    insertion
  nft_set_rbtree: Introduce and use nft_rbtree_interval_start()
  nft_set_rbtree: Detect partial overlaps on insertion
