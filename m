ACK. Maybe Florian has a case in mind which requires to serialize reset
and commit?

I wonder if hardcore 'reset the rules fetching counters' users care
about performance of ruleset changes at the same time. Maybe we
shouldn't care until someone complains?

Sorry, I don't recall. What did I promise to fix once someone complains?
NLM_F_EINTR handling in user space for reset commands? Is it broken??

I totally agree. And I didn't make the call for locking reset requests,
I'm just trying to answer it since it's my code that's broken in that
regard.

It passes with this series applied. It just takes long to finish (due to
10k retries). If it triggers, it usually does within ~100 tries. But it
depends, and I don't know how to increase the chances. Otherwise I would
have put this in a kselftest.
