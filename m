   yep, adding rule with port 0 (for bind) returns EINVAL then
   calling bind port 0 returns EACCES cause there is no rule with port 0.

  I think it's possible to have LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP with 
port 0 with LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP at the same time, cause 
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP rule is allowed (by Landlock) with any 
other port but 0.
