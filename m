Thanks.

netlink_get_setelem() calls netlink_dump_set() to display the debug
information. There the nls object key_type and data_type are not set.
The set object that was obtained from the evaluation phase is already
in place, it contains the key_type and data_type. You have to use it
to set the missing bits in nls accordingly.

Let me know if this works for you.
