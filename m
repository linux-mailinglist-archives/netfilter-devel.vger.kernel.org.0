bad idea!

nothing is locking you out just because of a short drop phase, at least 
not over the past 12 years, that's what tcp retransmits are for

when you once accept i have someone which should never have been 
accepted in the conntracking - sorry - but when i say drop i literally 
mean drop at any point in time
