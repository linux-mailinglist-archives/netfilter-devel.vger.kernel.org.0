Does the middle box have a chance to see any packet that provides a
hint to shorten this timeout? no HEARTBEAT packets are seen in this
case on the former primary path?

What I am missing are a more detailed list of issues with the existing
approach. Your patch description says "SCTP tracking with multihoming
is difficult", probably a list of scenarios would help to understand
the motivation to simplify the state machine.

Thanks.
