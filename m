Do you mean that this scenario works with patch-fix currently being
discussed?

Do you mean that ability to restrict auto-binding for connect() should
also be implemented? This looks like good idea if we want to provide
full control over port binding. But it's hard for me to come up with an
idea how it can be implemented: current Landlock API allows to restrict
only the destination port for connect().

I think an independent restriction of auto-binding for bind() and
listen() is a good approach: API is more clear and Landlock rules do
not affect each other's behavior. Did I understood your suggestion
correctly?

But check_tcp_socket_can_listen() will be required for
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_LISTEN_TCP hook anyway. Did I miss smth?

Thanks, I'll fix them.
