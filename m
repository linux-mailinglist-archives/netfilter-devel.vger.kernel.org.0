Sorry for the confusion -- what I meant was not "should we add the inline
keyword", but I meant "should we remove that function and place its
implementation in the place where we are currently calling it"?

What I found irritating about it is that with 0 layers (=3D no Landlock pol=
icy was
ever enabled), you would logically assume that we return a success?  But th=
en I
realized that this code was copied verbatim from other places in fs.c and n=
et.c,
and it is actually checking for an internal inconsistency that is never sup=
posed
to happen.  If we were to actually hit that case at some point, we have pro=
bably
stumbled over our own feet and it might be better to not permit anything.

Absolutely, please do open one.  In my mind, patches in C which might not g=
et
accepted are an expensive way to iterate on such ideas, and it might make s=
ense
to collect some refactoring approaches on a bug or the mailing list before
jumping into the implementation.

(You might want to keep an eye on https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/iss=
ues/1
as well, which is about some ideas to refactor Landlock's internal data
structures.)

That sounds good, thanks!
