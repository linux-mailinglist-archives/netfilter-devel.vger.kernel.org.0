Commit 7d93e2c2fbc7 (which makes it "configurable") is from March 2018.

Yes, hence worth a minor rework perhaps? I can take care of this at
some point.

Probably stupid but:

[ break nft ]

# mkdir "my secret binaries"
# cp /usr/bin/diff "my secret binaries/"
# export PATH="my secret binaries:$PATH"
# nftables/tests/shell/run-tests.sh nftables/tests/shell/testcases/listing/0003table_0
I: using nft command: nftables/tests/shell/../../src/nft

W: [FAILED]	nftables/tests/shell/testcases/listing/0003table_0: got 127
nftables/tests/shell/testcases/listing/0003table_0: line 15: my: command not found

I: results: [OK] 0 [FAILED] 1 [TOTAL] 1

or, perhaps more reasonable:

# grep DIFF=\" nftables/tests/shell/run-tests.sh
DIFF="diff -y"
# nftables/tests/shell/run-tests.sh nftables/tests/shell/testcases/listing/0003table_0
I: using nft command: nftables/tests/shell/../../src/nft

W: [FAILED]	nftables/tests/shell/testcases/listing/0003table_0: got 1

I: results: [OK] 0 [FAILED] 1 [TOTAL] 1

Personally, this bothers me more than some cheap, extra quotes. If the
general agreement is that it's not worth to add quotes to fix this,
fine, I would skip this the day I have time to propose the single
checking function rework I mentioned. Just let me know.
