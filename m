I don't think so, hash includes iifidx.

OK, that means probably driver needs to address the lack of iifidx in
the matching by dealling with more than one single flow entry to point
to one single hardware entry (refcounting?).

I would not expect a hang, packets will just flow over classic path
for a little while for the computer that is roaming until the new flow
entry is added.

Yes. In case letting expire stale flow entries with old iifidx is not enough
some other mechanism could be required.
