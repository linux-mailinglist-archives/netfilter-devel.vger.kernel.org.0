Right. In general, we need keys with fixed lengths, the NFT_CT_SRC
approach where key is variable length is a problem for the set
infrastructure, as you're describing.

There's a fix for this here:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/883575/

It requires kernel >= 4.17.

I wanted to have netlink descriptions to deal with this case, but so
far only probing is possible, and I would like not to open up for that
path.

I can just rebase, resubmit and merge it if you are fine with it.

Thanks.
