Well, rule_cache_dump() becomes dual-use, because the rule reset call is
so similar to the regular rule dump one.

I also changed it to allow turning the actual dump off (by sending
NLM_F_ACK instead of NLM_F_DUMP to kernel). This is used for resetting a
single rule (identified by rule-handle). Same functionality as with
resetting (a single) quota instead of "quotas".

If dump is active, the kernel returns the rules that have been reset to
user space, so users see the last state data. To correctly print this,
nft needs a table and chain cache. My v2 has this wrong, it needlessly
requests a rule cache also. Thanks for making me validate this aspect of
the implementation! :)

The only caveat I just noticed with reduced cache is that "whole ruleset
reset" does not print the rules because list_rule_cb() expects h->family
to be set. Making it accept NFPROTO_UNSPEC is trivial, though.

Cheers, Phil
