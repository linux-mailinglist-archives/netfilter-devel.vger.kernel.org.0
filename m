Please have a look and make an API proposal. Use the
libnetfilter_conntrack libmnl API for this.

Yes, dump filtered is fine to signal userspace.

I was thinking on how conntrack could use this. Problem is that this
depends on the kernel version. Unless there is a way to do some
probing to see if the filtering is in place, the userspace conntrack
utility cannot use this. Could you also have a look into that?

Thanks.
