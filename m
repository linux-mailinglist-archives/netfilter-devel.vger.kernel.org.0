From my point of view, yes. Though the third parameter "nentries" to
audit_log_nfcfg() is sometimes used in rather creative ways,
nf_tables_dump_obj() for instance passes the handle of the object being
reset instead of a count. So I assume whoever parses audit logs won't
rely too much upon the 'entries=NNN' part, anyway.

Thanks for your support, but I can take over, too. The number of
notifications emitted even for a small ruleset is not ideal, also. It's
just a bit sad that I ACKed the patch already and so it went out the
door. Florian, can we still put a veto there?

Cheers, Phil
