I still think they are orthogonal in practice (even though they
"clash"):

Dynamic sets use a timeout as they are populated from packet path and
may grow exceedingly large over time. Manual intervention means deleting
elements (which "resets" them) or adding ones (as an alternative to
packet path).

Would non-dynamic sets use both a timeout and other state? I can't
imagine a use-case for this.

I suggest to communicate the situation (for now) and make 'reset rule'
return the rule to user space so the non-plural reset commands (apart
from 'reset set') become reliable alternatives for those depending upon
it.

Setting expectations straight is still the easiest fix to both the
inconsistency problem and the "resets also timeouts" problem. In the
latter case, this should be fine already as nft(8) explicitly states
"resets timeout or other state" when describing 'reset element' and
'reset set'.

Then, consistent output for plural reset commands becomes a missing
feature one may add or not. Reset with or without timeout requires a
use-case (see above). The only real bug left is the concurrent reset
messing up values.

Cheers, Phil
