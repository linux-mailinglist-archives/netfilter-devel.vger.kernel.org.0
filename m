There is a v2 of this patch adding an explicit check for expiry to not
change upon element reset. Are you fine with that? For reference, its
message ID is 20231102175754.15020-1-phil@nwl.cc.

I see --stateless as a way to dump the ruleset in its basic form for a
fresh start with zeroed counters, etc. Hence why I wondered if it should
omit expiring elements as those are usually added by packet path or at
least explicitly after loading the ruleset itself.
