iptables is optimized for matching on input/output device name and
IPv4 address + mask (see ip_packet_match()) for historical reasons,
iptables does not use a match for this since the beginning.

One possibility (in the short-term) is to add an internal kernel
expression to achieve the same behaviour. The kernel needs to detects
for:

payload (nh, offset to ip saddr or ip daddr or ip protocol) + cmp
payload (nh, offset to ip saddr or ip daddr) + bitwise + cmp
meta (iifname or oifname) + bitwise + cmp
meta (iifname or oifname) + cmp

at the very beginning of the rule.

and squash these expressions into the "built-in" iptables match
expression which emulates ip_packet_match().

Not nice, but if microbenchmarks using thousand of rules really matter
(this is worst case O(n) linear list evaluation...) then it might make
sense to explore this.
