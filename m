Right, so the fixing should start in kernel repo, then update the cached
header in nftables.

AIUI, only in those including linux/if_ether.h directly. ;)
Though there is such include in nftables' src/payload.c which remains
unchanged by Alyssa's patch. Not sure if intentional, maybe there are
factors which make the include harmless.

According to a quick grep, there are currently six spots including
linux/if_ether.h (including one cached kernel header). I like about the
configure hack that it avoids breaking musl by accident via some
seemingly unrelated patch. Just one less thing to keep in mind, but this
is just me. I appreciate other opinions!

Cheers, Phil

PS: Can't we just fix musl instead? *hides*
