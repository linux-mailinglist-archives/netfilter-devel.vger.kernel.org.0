I see, in the userspace parser, W0 and W* are being handled as
OSF_WSS_PLAIN.

In the kernel, the struct nf_osf_user_finger is used as key to
identify each line, given they are identical.

So it looks like this EEXIST has been there since the beginning.

This patchset LGTM, it's just that the user might get confused if it
see errors when using this tool, probably turning this into a warning
is fine.

Or at least, include this information in the commit message so this
does not get lost :-)
