Sure, no question tracing and introspection is useful.

But could you use the generic workqueue trace points instead?

This is adding tracing infrastructure for a very specific purpose, to
inspect the workqueue behaviour for the flowtable.

And I am not sure how you use this yet other than observing that the
workqueue is coping with the workload?
