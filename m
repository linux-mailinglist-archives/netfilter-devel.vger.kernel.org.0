Ah, I wasn't aware you did that on purpose.

I didn't explicitly test for this case, but __nf_tables_dump_rules()
calls nf_tables_fill_rule_info() in a loop for reach rule. If it fails,
the function immediately returns 1 without calling
audit_log_rule_reset(). So while the last (failing) rule dump/reset will
be repeated after the detour to user space, the preceding rules
successfully dumped/reset slip through.

Yes, see the last part in the proposed kselftest[1]: Resetting rules in
a chain with 503 rules causes three notifications to be sent, for 189,
188 and 126 rules each.

If you prefer that, no problem. I'll prepare a v3 then.
