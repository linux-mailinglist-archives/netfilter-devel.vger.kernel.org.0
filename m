... which sets an incorrect destination MAC.  Also, in this case, 
netfilter doesn't reject any such thing.  It doesn't even "see" the RST 
packet dev_queue_xmit() sends out.  That's OK as there is no further need 
to process such a packet.  At least, the device whose connection 
request is being denied doesn't hang anymore...

I'm sticking to my guns.  I'm a firm believer in the KISS principle, part 
of a dying breed to be sure.
