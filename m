Yes.

Hm. I think we should not guess the handle that the kernel assigns.

In a batch, handles do not exist. We could expose the
intra-transaction index if needed to the user. But I don't see a
use-case for this.

I think we should leave the handle as a reference to already existing
rules in the kernel.
