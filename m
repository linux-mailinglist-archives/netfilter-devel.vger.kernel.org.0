Yes, recursive entry is possible even with local_bh_disable(), as
some of the xt_FOO extensions can send a packet (REJECT and TEE come
to mind), which can re-enter into ip_tables' traverser (*_do_table).

Yes, this is legacy only.

Unfortunately its not only about counters; local_bh_disable() is also
used to prevent messing up the chain jump stack.

For local hooks, this is called from process context, so in order
to avoid timers kicking in and then re-using the jumpstack, this
local_bh_disable avoids that.

The chain stack is percpu in -legacy, and on-stack in nf_tables.

Then, there is also recursion via xt_TEE.c, hence this strange
        if (static_key_false(&xt_tee_enabled))

in ipt_do_table() (We'll switch to a shadow-stack for that case).
