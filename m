But nft-test.py does check ruleset listing, that's what the optional
third part of a rule line is for. The syntax is roughly:

| <rule>;(fail|ok[;<rule_out>])

It allows us to cover for asymmetric rule listings. A simple example
from any/ct.t is:

| ct mark or 0x23 == 0x11;ok;ct mark | 0x00000023 == 0x00000011

So nft reports mark values with leading zeroes (don't ask me why ;).

Am I missing some extra your test does?

Cheers, Phil
