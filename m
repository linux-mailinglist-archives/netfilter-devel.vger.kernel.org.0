Yes, just do what Jan suggested and expost this in nft_meta.c

No, nft already has "< $value" logic.
The only missing piece of the puzzle is a way to populate an nft
register with the "size per segment" value.

It would be best to remove "static" from skb_gso_network_seglen() and
add an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for it.

Then, extend nft_meta.c to set register content to that for gso
or the ip/ipv6 packet size for !gso.

Then, extend nft to support something like

      nft insert rule bridge filter FORWARD \
        ip frag-off & 0x4000 != 0 \
        ip protocol tcp \
	meta nh_segment_length > 1400 \
        reject with icmp type frag-needed

[ NB: I suck at naming, so feel free to come up
  with somethng more descriptive than "nh_segment_length".
  l3size? nh-len...? ]
