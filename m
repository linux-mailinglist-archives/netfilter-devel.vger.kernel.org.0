Yes.

I see. I think the question is what this start timestamp is. For me,
it is the start time since the conntrack is _confirmed_ which is what
we expose to userspace via ctnetlink and /proc interface.

Is this user trying to trying to profile nfqueue? Why does this user
assume conntrack allocation time is the right spot to push the
timestamp on the ct?

On top of this, at that time I made this, I measured ~20-25%
performance drop to get this accurate timestamp, probably this is
cheaper now in modern equipment?
