Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Avoid gretap fragmentation with nftables on bridge

Hi,

I have a bridge with connects an gretap tunnel with some ethernet lan.
On the gretap device I use ignore-df to avoid packets being lost without
icmp reject to the sender of the bridged packet.

Still I want to avoid packet fragmentation with the gretap packets.
So I though about adding an nftables rule like this:

nft insert rule bridge filter FORWARD \
  ip protocol tcp \
  ip length > 1400 \
  ip frag-off & 0x4000 != 0 \
  reject with icmp type frag-needed

This would reject all tcp packets with ip dont-fragment bit set that are
bigger than some threshold (here 1400 bytes). The sender would then receive
ICMP unreachable - fragmentation needed and reduce its packet size (as
defined with PMTU).

This patch series
 1. adds frag-needed ipv4 flag to nftables
 2. enables to use this with bridge vlans.

For IPv6, this would need ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG instead of ICMPV6_DEST_UNREACH
in nft_reject_br_send_v6_unreach, so this is not part of this series.

Regards,
M. Braun
