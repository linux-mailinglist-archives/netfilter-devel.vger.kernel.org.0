Pardon my ignorance, but why is the id compared at all in conntrackd?

My claim is bogus, only the reply tuple is altered of course.

So Pablos suggestion above should work just fine.
Dirk, can you spin a v2 with that change?

It works fine for what its intended, I did not consider
the node pointer change after we link the ct to the dying list.

Might also resolve the earlier reported bug wrt. conntrackd table
exhaustion as the id changed after relink to dying list.

Alternative is to use IDA and allocate ID based on object,
thats very similar to the original (u32)addr but we need to store
the additional identifier in the conntrack object which i tried to avoid.
