I'd suggest you fix it from skb_find_text() to discard a match if it
goes over the "--to" boundary.

I think the "slidding" matching after the to boundary (that only works
with linear skbuff) is something the user does not want, when they
specify a [ from, to ] range, they really mean to narrow it down to
such range.

And if the user ever wants this, a flag could be exposed to provide
such behaviour.

Thanks.
