Hi Tom,

Just in case you missed it, be sure that your logger is configured not to sync
the file system after every logging. That is the default action btw.

I have used large-volume logging in the past and never encountered a CPU problem
(but had to run logrotate every minute to avoid filling the disk).

Cheers ... Duncan.
