It should be easy to fix from kernel side, right? I can step so
remaining NFT_EXPR_STATEFUL also implement this. I mean, otherwise we
might have to document that some kernels do not support reset, some
kernel support reset of counter and quota only and some kernels fully
support all of the stateful objects :)

This can be done later from userspace. The reset for limit is a bit
special, because it currently does not exposed state information from
the listing side.
