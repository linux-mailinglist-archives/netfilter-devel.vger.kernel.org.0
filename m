Well, right now it serves as a backend for all attribute setters, and
your patch continues in that tradition. So while it may be a bit
"rustic", I'd say it's good enough for its purpose. :)

While I think your patch is the right way to providing a sanitized
access to the array attributes, I don't think it's really related to
what my original patch was fixing, which is:

Right now we are preventing users from passing wrong attribute types to
getters by checking the attribute length. This does not work for
NFTNL_CHAIN_DEVICES or NFTNL_FLOWTABLE_DEVICES because they don't set
data_len. Hence the expression in nftnl_asser() call:

| nftnl_assert(val, attr, data_len == sizeof(<something>));

Will lead to comparing with garbage from stack. This may in most cases
fail as expected, but there's no guarantee.

Your patch allows to use "a better" getter/setter for those problematic
attributes, but it doesn't prevent the above from happening.

My first approach was to make nftnl_chain_get_data() and
nftnl_flowtable_get_data() set:

| *data_len = 0;

for the problematic attributes, but the value is not really correct - a
"more correct" value, e.g.:

| *data_len = c->dev_array_len * sizeof(char *);

Could lead to a pass in getter sanitizing by accident although e.g.
nftnl_chain_get_u64() is completely unfit even if c->dev_array_len was
1.

So I decided to go the safe way and initialize data_len variables to zero
instead which has the benefit of catching new attributes added later as
well.

If you don't like the approach of initializing all data_len variables, I
would rather suggest to go with setting '*data_len = 0' in _get_data()
routines as described above. This has the same effect but it's just a
two lines change. What do you think?

Cheers, Phil
