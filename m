I can add bla.nft and use nft --check -f bla.nft.

Or, I can add bla.sh, which does

exec $NFT -f - <<EOF
table ...
EOF

I see zero reason why we can't add scripts later on if there
are cases where flat-files don't work.

At this point, its just more boilerplate to add a script wrapper
around the .nft file.

No, but the test that should be skipped can do

$NFT -j list ruleset || exit 77

as first line of the script, no need to load any files, nft will fail
with error in case its not built with json support.

Sure, I see no reason why to not have both.  The flat files have the
'*nft' suffix for a reason...

I'll no longer work on this for the remainder of the month due to
time constraints.
