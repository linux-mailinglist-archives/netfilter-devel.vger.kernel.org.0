Sorry, I don't understand your approach. With protocol context as it is
used in nftables in mind, I don't see how that applies here. For among
match, we simply have a payload match for MAC address and optionally a
second one for IP address. These are not related apart from the fact
that among allows to match only source or only destination addresses.
The problem lookup_analyze_payloads() solves is:

1) Are we matching MAC only or MAC and IP?
2) Are we matching source or destination?
3) Is everything consistent, i.e., no IP match without MAC one and no
   mixed source/destination matches?

If (3) evaluates false, there may be a different extension this lookups
suits for, but currently such a lookup is simply ignored.

Ah, sorry. The 'type' values are TYPE_LLADDR and TYPE_IPADDR from
nftables' enum datatypes. Seems like neither kernel nor libnftnl care
about it, so this is useful only to make nft list things correctly.

Values added to 'len' are four bytes IPv4 address length and two bytes
padding. I'll try to find more illustrative ways to write them.

OK, cool. I started implementing the inline anonymous set idea already,
but kernel code becomes pretty ugly when trying to create a new set from
within expr_ops->init. :(

Thanks, Phil
