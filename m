My proposal:

- Add support for cookies, this is an identifier that the user can
  specify when the object is created, this is allocated by the user.
  We already discussed this in the past for different purpose. The idea
  would be to add a _COOKIE attribute to the objects, which is dumped
  via netlink.
- Add the alternative compat representation to the userdata, use the
  cookie identifier to refer to the anonymous set. By the time you
  create the anonymous set, you can already

With this approach, you add cookie support - which is something that
has been already discussed in the past - and you can use it from the
userdata to refer to the anonymous set.

If you fall back to the compat representation, then you look at the
userdata and, if there is a cookie reference, you can fetch the object
accordingly and put all pieces together to print the rule.

You could possibly make this without kernel updates? Add an internal
cookie field in userdata, that is included in the anonymous set. Then,
from the rule userdata, you refer to the internal cookie that refers
to the anonymous set. In such case, you can implement all what you
need from userspace, without kernel updates, to deal with this "forward
compatibility" requirement for the containers case.
