it is not transparent enough because it don't understand classical ipset

my shell scripts creating the ruleset, cahins and ipsets can be switched
from iptables-legacy to iptables-nft and before the reboot despite the
warning that both are loaded it *looked* more or less fine comparing the
rulset from both backends

i gave it one try and used "iptables-nft-restore" and "ip6tables-nft",
after reboot nothing worked at all

via console i called "firewall.sh" again wich would delete all rules and
chains followed by re-create them, no success and errors that things
already exist

please don't consider to drop iptables-legacy, it just works and im miss
a compelling argument to rework thousands of hours
