Hello Mikhail!

I would also be interested in seeing this patch set land. :)
Do you think you would be able to pick this up again?


To refresh my memory, I also had a look at V3 again; One of the last big
questions here was the userspace API in struct landlock_socket_attr.

To briefly recap that discussion, what we settled on at the end [1] was tha=
t we
can use special wildcard values for some of the members of that struct, so =
that
it looks like this:

struct landlock_socket_attr {
  __u64 allowed_access;
  int family;   /* same as domain in socket(2)    (required, never a wildca=
rd) */
  int type;     /* same as type in socket(2),     or the wildcard value (i6=
4)-1 */
  int protocol; /* same as protocol in socket(2), or the wildcard value (i6=
4)-1 */
};

(In other words, we have discarded the ideas of "handled_socket_layers" and
using bitmasks to specify different values for the socket(2) arguments.)

So, when an attempt is made to call socket(family, type, protocol), Landloc=
k has
to check for the presence of the following keys in the RB-tree:

 1. (family, type, protocol)
 2. (family, type, *)
 3. (family, *,    *)
 4. (family, *,    protocol)

but is an acceptable compromise to make ([1]).

Small remark: The four lookups sound bad, but I suspect that in many cases,=
 only
variant 1 (and maybe 2) will be used at all.  If you create four separate s=
truct
rb_root for these four cases, then if the more obscure variants are unused,=
 the
lookups for these will be almost for free.  (An empty rb_root contains only=
 a
single NULL-pointer.)


I hope this is a reasonable summary of the discussion at [1] and helps to
unblock the progress here?  Mikhail, are there any other open points which =
are
blocking you on this patch set?
