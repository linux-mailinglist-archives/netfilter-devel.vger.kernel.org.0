Ah, that's a good point. Users always see rev0 help texts, which are
naturally the most limited ones.

I see, thanks. Yet your approach works only if the module is loaded

Unless it's useful elsewhere as well, I don't think it's worth the
effort for iptables alone - requesting extension help as non-root is
quite a corner-case IMHO.
