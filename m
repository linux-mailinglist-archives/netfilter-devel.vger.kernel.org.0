If you want to get formal about this, you need to define "target" in
the sentence above.  Target of what?

FWIW, I read the above to basically mean that a task can only set the
audit container ID of processes which are beneath it in the "process
tree" where the "process tree" is defined as the relationship between
a parent and children processes such that the children processes are
branches below the parent process.

I have no problem with that, with the understanding that nesting
complicates it somewhat.  For example, this isn't true when one of the
children is a nested orchestrator, is it?

I thought we decided we were going to allow an orchestrator to move a
process between audit container IDs, yes?  no?

Try rephrasing the above please, it isn't clear to me what you are
trying to say.

See above.

If you want to go back to the definitions/assumptions stage, it
probably isn't worth worrying about the other comments until we get
the above sorted.
