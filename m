We should untagged as deprecated libnetfilter_queue old interface in
the documentation, it's fine to keep it there, it should be possible
to make it work over libmnl.

There is absolutely no urgency.

This patch have a number of showstoppers such as exposing structure
layout on the header files.

I think the goal is to avoid the memcpy() I posted a patch sketch
time ago to follow a more simple approach that we can resurrect,
polish and upstream to remove the extra copy.

Thanks.
