Thanks.

My suggestion is that you can take them and place them at the
beginning of your batch since it will be the first client for this new
netlink attribute, you will have to adapt pipapo to use the new
key_end value too.

I still have to send you the libnftnl part for this.

Not sure I understand, probably some code sketch? From your words it
does not look like a major issue though, but let me know.

BTW, there is also one more pending issue: I can see there is a clone
point in nft_set_pipapo, you mentioned some problems to make things
fit in into the transaction infrastructure. Could you describe how you
integrate with it? Probably there is a chance to extend the front-end
API too to make it easier for pipapo.

Thanks.
