Where is this new port-shift flag needed?  NAT engine?
I'm a bit confused, are you proposing new/different syntax for Jeremys
kernel-patchset or something else?

AFAICS, for what you want do to, Jeremys kernel patches should
already work as-is?

Just to be clear again, I have no objects to the kernel patches
that Jeremy proposed.  I just dislike the iptables-inspired userspace
syntax with a need to explicitly state the left edge of the range.

Isn't that essentially what Jeremys patchset is already doing, i.e.
adding a new register to store the offset?

You can't use an immediate, else maps with different deltas don't work.

You mean a pseudotype to work with 'typeof'? We alreay do this for
verdicts so this should work.
