In my code, I add/delete firewall rules multiple times from one main process (without killing the main process in between) by calling xtables_init_all, xtables_register_target and xtables_register_match every time. When a rule is added, I call xtables_fini to clean up.

I don't think you should call xtables_register_{target,match} over and
over again. Why don't you follow what iptables does and call
xtables_find_{target,match} to lookup an extension? It tries loading the
DSO which calls xtables_register_*. After adding the rule, you should
free the rule, not deinit the library.

Your patch seems to leak memory because the list elements are not freed.

Cheers, Phil
