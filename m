I see, you mean to use this (from iptables):

commit 76fce22826f8e860b5eb5b5a2463040c17ff85da
Author: Joshua Lant <joshualant@googlemail.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 28 13:47:31 2024 +0100

    configure: Determine if musl is used for build

and adapt to use it from nftables (and everywhere else).

Alyssa's patch is more simple, but it is mangling a cache kernel
header.

Is this configure.ac workaround needed everywhere in the netfilter.org
trees to make musl happy?

I don't see any better option at this stage.

Thanks.
