This cookie idea provides an alternative to skip the input and output
json string comparison, you have to combine it with --echo.

You will still need to use the handle to uniquely identify the rule by
processing the echo message (compare the cookie you set in the rule
that is sent to the kernel, instead of comparing strings).

The input and output json string comparison might be a problem in the
midterm. New netlink attributes and old kernels might result in
different input and output json string.

This is not aiming to provide a mechanism to delete rules by other
than the rule handle.
