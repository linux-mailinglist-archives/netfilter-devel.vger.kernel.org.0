Right.

Can you suggest an alternative?

I see the following:

- revert to old behaviour (no search,
  lookup-by-name), and introduce a new netlink attribute for the 'wildcard
  name / full-search'.
  Since thats a big change this requires a revert in nf.git and then a
  followup change in nf-next to amend this.

- Only search if we have a wildcard.
  It should be enough to check, from nft_netdev_hook_alloc, if hook->ifname
  is null-terminated or not. If it is, lookup-by-name, else
  for_each_netdev search.

  Thats assuming that the netlink attributes are encoded as
  'eth\0' (4 bytes, no wildcard), vs 'eth' (3 bytes, wildcard).

Regardless of this flag patch one could update nftables userspace to
display hints like we do for sets with the new '# count 42' comment
annotation.

Something that tells that the hook is subscribed for eth42 but currently
not active.

Same with flowtables, something that tells which devices are configured
(subscribed) and which devices are used (should likely still display
 ppp* and not list 4000k ppp1234 :-) ).

Phil, whats your take here?

From a quick glance there is currently no way for a user to tell if the
hook is active or not (except by adding a dummy counter rule).

Makes sense to me.

Yes.
