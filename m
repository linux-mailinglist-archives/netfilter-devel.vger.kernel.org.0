I think it would be preferrable to have a patch 2/3 that first adds
new .nft dump files for all tests where the output is stable, and then
only add the .nodump files (this patch) for those where dump validation
cannot work.

I suspect that most will pass as expected.
Even an empty dump file can be useful because this would catch
(unlikely) bugs with delete/flush failure.

We could simplify some scripts later on, some of the no-dump scripts
manually validate output, that isn't needed anymore after this.
