Agreed, users will be expecting consistent behaviour with the existing
net-device based tunneling infrastructure. The hook order you are
proposing look correct to me.

If you go for option 2, you can add a new specific static_key for
the lightweight tunnel netfilter hooks, this static key could be
turned on via sysctl. But I think this sysctl toggle should be
one-time (once enabled, you cannot disable it).

I'll help you with the benchmarking.

I'd prefer option 1 too, I tend to dislike new sysctl toggles, the
specific static_key should remove the concern on the performance
impact for people that do not want to use this new infrastructure.

Thanks.
