ct->ext also might change while packet is in transit, since new
extension can be added too.

&ct->tuplehash was not good either for event retransmission, since
hnnode might change (when moving the object to the dying list), so
ct->tuplehash[x].tuple looks good to me.

@Florian: by mangling this patch not to use ct->ext, including Dirk's
update, conntrackd works again (remember that bug we discussed during
NFWS).

I think it's safe to turn this into:

        a = (unsigned long)ct;
        b = (unsigned long)ct->master;
        c = (unsigned long)nf_ct_net(ct));
        d = (unsigned long)siphash(&ct->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_ORIGINAL].tuple, sizeof(ct->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_ORIGINAL].tuple);
