Ah! Thanks a lot for your elaborations. It was really hard to grasp what
all this is about from the initial commit message. :)

Sometimes I wonder if we should do more set optimizations under the hood
when adding elements. Right now, we don't touch existing ones although
it would make sense. And we could be more intelligent for example if a
set contains 20-30 and a user adds 25-35.

Cheers, Phil
