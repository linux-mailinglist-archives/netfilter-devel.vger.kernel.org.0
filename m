Yes, and that's what I'm arguing against: it would be more natural, in
a transaction, to have a single commit operation for all the elements
at hand -- otherwise it's not so much of a transaction.

To the user it's atomic (minus bugs) because we have tricks to ensure
it, but to the set back-ends it's absolutely not. I think we have this
kind of situation:


nft            <->     core       <->   set back-end    <->    storage
                |                  |                     |

hash:   transaction commit    element commit       element commit

rbtree: transaction commit    element commit       element commit
                                                   ^ problematic to the
                                                   point we're
                                                   considering a
                                                   transaction approach

pipapo: transaction commit    element commit       transaction commit

The single advantage I see of the current approach is that with the
hash back-ends we don't need two copies of the hash table, but that
also has the downside of the nft_set_elem_active(&he->ext, genmask)
check in the lookup function, which should be, in relative terms, even
more expensive than it is in the pipapo implementation, given that hash
back-ends are (in most cases) faster.
