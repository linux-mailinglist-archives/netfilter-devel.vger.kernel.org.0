Yes, I am inclined not to add more features to bf2ac490d28c (and
follow up fixes patches that came with it).

I think this at least needs more discussion, I think we are now
understanding the implications of bf2ac490d28c.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

I think Nikolaos pointed out that _BEGIN+NLM_F_ACK could actually
provide an indication, with the assumption that the netlink userspace
queue is going to be empty because it will be the first
acknowledgement...

Yes, I would start with this approach you propose, then keep
discussing if it makes sense to keep extending bf2ac490d28c or leave
it as is.
