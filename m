When there is no service listening in the specified port in the backend,
we get a reset packet from the backend that is sent to the client but
the sequence number mismatches the tcp stream one so there is a loop in
which the client is requesting it until the timeout.

To solve this we need to adjust the sequence number, we cannot use the
!SEEN_REPLY_BIT test because it is always false at this point and then
we never get into the if statement. Instead of check the !SEEN_REPLY_BIT
we need to check if the CT IP address is different to the original CT IP.

I hope that answers your questions, here is the tcpdump output with only
the important information. Please note that "netfilter" is the synproxy
machine and 192.168.122.1 is the client. If that is fine to you, I will
include this description into the commit message and send a v3 patch.
Thanks Florian! :-)
