Thanks for catching this. Seems like at some point the intention was to
have a common 'xtables' command and pass -4/-6 parameters to toggle
between iptables and ip6tables operation. Pablo, is this still relevant,
or can we just get rid of it altogether?

Would you mind creating a testcase in iptables/tests/shell? I guess
testcases/ipt-restore is suitable, please have a look at
0003-restore-ordering_0 in that directory for an illustration of how we
usually check results of *-restore calls.

On my testing VM this rule ends up in table ip filter, so this seems to
not even work as intended.
