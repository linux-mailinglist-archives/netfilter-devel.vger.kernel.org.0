This issue is because the WARN_ON_ONCE() is triggered by any 
non-landlocked process, so removing the WARN_ON_ONCE() will fix that.

It looks like htmldocs doesn't like #if in enum definition. Anyway, I 
think it should be better to not conditionally define an enum. I've 
pushed this change here: https://git.kernel.org/mic/c/8c96c7eee3ff 
(landlock-net-v11 branch)
