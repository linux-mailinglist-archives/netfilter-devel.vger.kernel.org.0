Yes. In practise, you can put anything over netlink (someone decided
to sending strings, not even TLVs)...

But two different types provides clear semantics, no need to peek on
the value to know what to do.

Please, fix it so we can do better in the future.

OK.

I suggest you formally submit this for nf.git including userspace
patches? Then, request it to be included in -stable. We probably have
to skip including this userspace code in the next 1.1.4 release.
Unless anyone have a better proposal to handle this. I'm sorry I did
not bring up this issue sooner.

I don't think it is worth, as for old user space, IMO the only
reasonable thing we can do is:

- do not crash.
- highlight that old user space is skipping unknown stuff.

Other than that, we would have to explore a generic way to print raw
attributes, then extend the parser to allow this, which I am not
convinced yet it is worth the effort.
