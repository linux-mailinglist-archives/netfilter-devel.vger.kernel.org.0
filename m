I guess "family" would also make sense. It's the name used in the 
kernel, the "AF" prefixes, and address_families(7). I'm not sure why 
"domain" was chosen for socket(2).

I understand the rationale but I'm not sure if this would be useful. Do 
you have use cases?

I don't think "accept" would be useful, and I'm not sure if "bind" and 
"connect" would not be redundant with LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_{CONNECT,BIND}_TCP
Bind and connect for a datagram socket is optional, so this might lead 
to a false sense of security. If we want to support protocols other than 
TCP to restrict bind/connect, then they deserve to be controlled 
according to a port (or similar).
