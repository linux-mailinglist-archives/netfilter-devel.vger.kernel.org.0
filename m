Correct, even if a port is not a *kernel* object.

Yes, it's possible an it's OK because the bind action was performed by 
an unsandboxed process. If this unsandboxed process is not trusted or if 
it can be fooled by a malicious client, the system should be designed to 
make it not able to talk to the sandboxed process.
