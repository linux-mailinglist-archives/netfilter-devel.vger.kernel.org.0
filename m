Hi,

Sorry for jumping back into the discussion this late.

The problem is that user tried to add a new element which is not yet
contained and the 'add element' command is the same as if it was
identical to an existing one. We must not ignore this situation as the
user needs to know: In the above case e.g., element '35 . 40' won't
match after the zero-return from 'add element' command.

At first I assumed we could merge e.g.:

| { 20-30 . 40-50, 25-35 . 45-55 }

into:

| { 20-35 . 40-55 }

But now I realize this is wrong. We would match e.g. '{ 20 . 55 }', a
combination the user never specified.

Given that merging multiple concatenated ranges is a non-trivial task, I
guess the only sane thing to do (for now at least) is to perform overlap
detection in user space and reject the command if an overlap is
detected. Stefano, do you see any problems with that?

Thanks, Phil
