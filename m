I didn't get your comment: all this patch does is to skip the initial
LDMXCSR in kernel_fpu_begin(), because the instructions we use in the
lookup functions don't touch or rely on MCXSR, so a valid initial state
doesn't look relevant to me.

Later on, in the lookup functions, I ordered AVX instructions manually
anyway to minimise stalls.

What am I missing? Do you mean that LDMXCSR would come at a lower or no
cost if ordered differently?
