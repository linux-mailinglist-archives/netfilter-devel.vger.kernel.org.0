Hello Günther,
No problem, thanks a lot for your feedback!

Yeap. Following rule will be enough to allow TCP sockets only:

const struct landlock_socket_attr create_socket_attr = {
	.allowed_access = LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE,
	.family = AF_INET{,6},
	.type = SOCK_STREAM,
	.protocol = 0
};

Btw, creation of SMC sockets via IP stack was added quite recently.
So far, creation has been possible only with AF_SMC family.

Agreed

This table is the general drawback, since it makes API a bit more
complex.

I think the socket_type_to_security_class() has a pretty good mapping
for UNIX and IP families.

Something like this?

const struct landlock_socket_attr create_socket_attr = {
	.allowed_access = LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE,
	.family = AF_INET6,
	.type = SOCK_DGRAM,
	.protocol = LANDLOCK_SOCKET_PROTO_ALL
};
