Yes, sure. If iptables-legacy moved at the pace iptables-nft did and
containers were a thing back then, the same situation had arisen. I
don't even see us in charge to solve the problem, other tools lack
forward compatibility, too. And I have not seen any guarantees about
mixed use of different tool versions. The only reason I see for
iptables-nft to attempt such a guarantee is its perspective of replacing
itself internally with native nftables expressions, in consequence the
tendency of each new version to break compatibility for the previous
one.

Introducing a mode which creates a compatible ruleset for users
requiring it should be enough from my point of view. Sure, one may argue
it hinders future deprecation of xtables extensions in kernel. But the
active use of older versions of iptables-nft does that already.

Commandline (or input file) parser creates match and target objects
which add_match() may or may not turn into native code. In compat mode,
one could always allocate a "match" expression and call __add_match().

In turn, nftnl_rule parser creates match and target objects from native
expressions (if supported). Upon encountering a "match" object, it
merely does an extension lookup and copies the payload into the
allocated object.

So compat mode is a flag for iptables-nft-restore and 'iptables-nft -A',
the reverse path works automatically.

Cheers, Phil
