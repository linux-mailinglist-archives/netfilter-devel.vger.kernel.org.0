It's the Internet and DNS connectivity that are inherently not
deterministic. The Internet is a best-effort network or in other words
non-deterministic, so any network filter for the Internet can only be
best-effort.

The patch simply makes the netfilter behaviour adaptive to that
inherent principle and fault-tolerant.

Priting a warning and recoverying in a best-effort manner from an
unrecoverable failure is the best a network filter can do.

A partial failure is always better than a total failure.

The former is just an expensive trick. The latter might be an
alternative solution to the problem, but it is more complex than just
rescheduling netfilter setup after network (or DNS) comes up again.

You need quite a lot of C code in order to cache DNS lookups, while you
only need a script to reload the netfilter.

There is no prescription on being deterministic, when the underlying
network is inherently non-deterministic.

It has already been discussed that even when DNS Round-Robin is not
being used for a specific host, the host might still change its IP
address on a slowly-varying timescale: in such scenario hostname-based
filtering rules significantly simplify network management and minimize
network downtimes.

In any case, hostname-based rules are optional and using or not using
them is entirely discretional, the patch does not force the use of
hostname-based rules, it just makes them fault-tolerant.

If a DNS lookup fails, it can be due to a DNS failure as you said but
also to a completely unreachable DNS server or a completely unreachable
network (no connectivity at all): so circumstances might vary.

In the case of an Internet client such as a workstation, most Internet
connectivity happens through DNS lookups: you generally don't type IP
addresses in your web browser or ftp client.

So, if the DNS lookup fails, no matter what the reason actually is (DNS
failure or network failure), the client request will also most probably
fail, no matter whether its resolved IP address is actually reachable
or not, because the request is most likely based on an hostname.

Static IP addresses are normally only used for connectivity between
servers: in that case, the code in the patch is not used and things
stay as they are.

I hope this helps...
