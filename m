Yes, exactly -- note that it was possible (and, I think, used) before.

Wait, though: that's only the case if we update the counters for
matching *elements* and not necessarily matching *rules*, which was the
case before 4750005a85f7, or with this patch.

Otherwise, the sentence I wrote is not accurate. I can try to come up
with another one to describe the current behaviour, but I'll need some
calm minutes with pencil and paper tomorrow.

Still, if counters are updated with just matching element, but not
necessarily matching rule, they should be as useful as in the hypothesis
of introducing a "decrementing" feature -- one just needs to adjust the
rule logic to that.

Okay, but what you're describing is the "! --update-counters" option.
That works, didn't work before 4750005a85f7, but would still work with
this change.

What I meant is really the case where "--update-counters" (or
"--force-update-counters") and "! --update-counters" are both absent: I
don't see any particular advantage in the current behaviour for that
case.
