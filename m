This should not silently truncate strings, instead bail out to user in
case the string is too long.

#define NF_LOG_PREFIXLEN       128

Maximum length as specified by uapi/linux/netfilter/nf_log.h

Currently in userspace, if I specify a string longest than that, I can
see ASAN complains on incorrect memory management from userspace
(without your patchset), so this code is currently broken (by me
mostly likely since I was the last one to touch those bits).

While at this, it would be good to fix it and add a test to cover
maximum prefix length.

Regarding meta_key_parse(), these days the preferred approach is to
use start conditions in flex. This function should go away, it was an
early attempt to reduce tokens by using STRING from bison, which
turned out to be flawed.

It is not worth to fix meta_key_parse(), flex start conditions and
bison parser should be used.

This macro is hiding behind a bit of technical debt.
