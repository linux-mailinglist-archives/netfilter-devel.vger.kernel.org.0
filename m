Its complete (both the sleepable-iter linked above and this RFC).
The RFC omits conversion of NETSETELEM however.
I did not spend time on that because I'm not sure I'm following your
suggestion in the first place.

Yes.  The memory saving would come from no-need for elems[], except for
update case.

Atm we can store 124 elements in one nft_trans structure.  Each
nft_trans_elem has 2k size, to hold the pointers to the elements
added/removed.

But with list based approach you need one nft_trans struct only (96
byte) in ideal conditions (same op on same set, e.g. flush case).

So its in the 96 byte vs. 163840 bytes range for 10.000 elem del/add.

The downside is the permanent 8-byte per element increase.
But, the truckload of temporary trans objects will be gone.

Yes, there is.  If you agree I will try to extend the RFC patchset:
- add one patch to convert NEWSETELEM case
- add one patch to get rid of elems[].
  Unless you think there is a use case for update from userspace
  that makes a mass update of a set, such as modifying the timeout
  of 1k elements, then it would be better to keep elems[] and use it
  only for update case.  Let me know what you think -- I don't think
  its a scenario worth optimizing for.
