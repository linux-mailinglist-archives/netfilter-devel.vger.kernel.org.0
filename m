Hello Jeremy,

I just wanted to thank you for picking up my feature request. I really appreciate your work.

I would also vote for the AC_CHECK_LIB([linenoise], ...) variant instead of including the source.
SQLite also does it this way.
Furthermore we already have a linenoise library in our BSP. This way we can reuse it for nftables.

I'm looking forward for the next release including the support.

Thx
Sebastian
