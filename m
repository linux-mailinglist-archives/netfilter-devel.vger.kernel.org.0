Famous last words. :(

I realized anonymous sets are indeed a problem, and I'm not sure how it
could be solved. I missed the fact that with lookup expressions one has
to run the init() callback to convert their per-batch set ID into the
kernel-defined set name. So the simple "copy and return nla" approach is
not sufficient.

Initializing all of the dump-only expressions though causes other
unwanted side-effects, like e.g. duplicated chain use-counters.

One could ban lookup from being used in dump-only expressions. Right
now, only ebtables' among match requires it.

To still allow for ebtables-nft to use the compat interface, among match
could be rewritten to use the legacy extension in-kernel. This doesn't
solve the original problem though, because old ebtables-nft versions
can't parse a match expression containing among extension.

Another option that might work is to parse the dump-only expressions in
nf_tables_newrule(), dump them into an skb, drop them again and extract
the skb's buffer for later.

Do you have a better idea perhaps? I'm a bit clueless how to proceed
further right now. :(

Cheers, Phil
