Hey.

Thanks for having a look. :-)

I see.

Not that I'd reject reworking this, but wearing my user hat, I'd say
that the user rather doesn't care so much whether in strict terminology
this is a verdict or not - cause from the user's PoV this is simply
like a verdict (i.e. causing - along with sending a reply - to either
accept/reject the packet).

What would you think about changing it roughly as follows (at this
place, as well as perhaps in my new summary chapter about how
evaluation works):
- remove the rejects from next to the drops
- add a paragraph which describes that there are verdict-like
  statements, which a) do some extra stuff and b) cause one of the true
  verdicts (drop/accept)
- along with that add a list which explains which such statement causes
  which verdict

What's IMO important from the user PoV is that for example at a
sentence like:
>*accept* and *drop*/*reject* are absolute verdicts, which immediately
> terminate the evaluation of the current rule, i.e. even any later
> statements of the current rule won=E2=80=99t get executed

he also gets told that the very same concept (here: later statements
not being executed) applies also to verdict-like statements like reject
(if that's the case).

The user doesn't want to have to read through the whole manpage to
eventually realise that reject behaves effectively like drop here.
And even if you refer to the REJECT section and mention it there, it
makes things IMO more difficult to understand.

That's basically the reason why I propose this evaluation summary
chapter, because with the information spread out over many places it's
more difficult to grasp the big picture.


But back to verdict/verdict-like statements:
Are jump/goto/return/etc. then true verdicts? I wouldn't guess so, yet
they already are explained in the verdict section.

I'm not sure how much we win, by differentiating between these two, and
even if we do so, how shall we call things like reject? "verdict like
statements"? "statements that imply a verdict"?

Is there a complete list of all these which are verdict-like and what
verdict they actually imply?

Same solution as I'd propose above?!

I do mention it in my summary chapter.

In the section on the verdicts you're referring to it follows
implicitly from the description of the *jump* statement, but at least
there I'd also think it's perhaps good to explicitly mention it in
parentheses.

Whether we also mentioned it in the return description, I don't mind.
We can, so to say as extra information, but it's IMO not strictly
necessary. Because if someone looks up the book for the return
statement he most likely wants to know what happens we issuing it - not
which other things (he wasn't looking up) also behave in some cases
like the statement he was looking up.

But again... I'd be fine either way.

Uff... okay... that makes things quite a bit harder to describe.

So effectively that means, return (explicit or implicit) it not really
equivalent to the policy, as claimed for at least base-chains in the
current manpage:

But rather *if* there's nowhere to return to (like when it's called
from a base-chain) *then* the policy is applied, right!?

I merely had checked calling return from a regular chain into which
I've jumped to from the base-chain, ... that together with the above
sentence from the manpage, made me think it would work that way.

As far as I understand it now:
  base --jump--> regularA --goto--> regularB
then at the end of regularB or if return is called in it, while I don't
return to regularA, I actually will return to the jump position in
base, right?

Similar in:
  base --jump--> regularA --jump--> regularB --goto--> regularC
I will not return to regularB, but will return to the jump position of
regularA and then to that of base, right?


Very open for opinions, but I do think with that semantics it actually
might be best to describe things with a call stack an give some
examples.

What do you think?

Cheers,
Chris.
