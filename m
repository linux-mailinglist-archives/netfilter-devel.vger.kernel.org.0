Actually not correct what I said in this case: NLM_F_EXCL means create
in newsetelem() path, then add new E3 always succeeds if there is a
timed out E3, regardless the flag.

No "does not exist" error is possible.

Please, revisit if the semantics look correct to you after my
correction on the NLM_F_EXCL flag.

I think it is not a good idea to expand a element that has already
expired. There might be another possible corner case:

Refresh element E1 with timeout X -> not expired yet
Element E1 expires
Refresh element E1 with timeout Y -> already expired, ENOENT.

This looks fine to me, this handling is possible because the timeout
is not updated from the preparation phase, only later in the commit
phase.
