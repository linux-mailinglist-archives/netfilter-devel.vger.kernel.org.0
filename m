Ah yes, that's an obvious change and there's nothing we can do about it.
Unlike legacy iptables, there are no dedicated modules supporting each
table in iptables-nft. For instance, nft_chain_filter.ko suffices for
raw, filter and security tables. For nat table you need nft_chain_nat.ko
and mangle needs nft_chain_route.ko (actually just for OUTPUT chain).

For iptables-services in Fedora, I simply hard-coded the table names.

Cheers, Phil
