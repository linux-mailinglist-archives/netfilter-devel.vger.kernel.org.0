Thanks, I'll place this into nf.git

BTW, I assume this mitigates the problem that Eric reported? Is it
not so easy to trigger the problem after this patch?

I forgot to say, probably it would be good to monitor
/proc/net/netlink to catch how busy the socket receive buffer is
getting with your firewalld ruleset.

Thanks.
