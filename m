Yes, we need a more nice way to do this work. It's easy for RR,
but a little complex for WRR, after I figure out how WRR works.

Using a user tool to add dests in random order is an option, which
I thought about before. But it needs users to make some extra
changes.

Thanks for your explanation. The options you mentioned are mature
and significant. I'll make them together and try to find the best way,
after I dig into the ipvs code deeper.

Yeah, it seems that the range of the lock can be reduced. I
think I'm able to handle it.
