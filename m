Auto-increased generation ID may not meet the above requirement as the
table could also be frequently updated by configuration changes at
runtime, not only after the application upgrades. An example scenario
could be: say we have a loadbalancer application based on nftables:

* LB v0.1.0 installs a collection of nftable rules;
* LB v0.1.1 makes some changes compatible with v0.1.0. In upgrade case,
  it doesn't need to recreate the whole table if the existing rules
  were installed by version >= 0.1.0;
* LB v0.2.0 makes some changes incompatible with v0.1.x (e.g. some
  chains' priorities are changed), it needs to recreate the whole table
  when upgrading from v0.1.x to it;
* LB v0.2.1 makes some changes compatible with v0.2.0, it doesn't need
  to recreate the table when upgrading from v0.2.0 to it but needs to
  recreate it when upgrading from v0.1.x to it.

With the support for comment updates, we can store, get, and update
such version information in comment, and use it to determine when it's
necessary to recreate the table.

I tried to detect back-to-back userdata comment updates, but found it's
more complex than I thought. A flag may not work because it can only
tell whether the 1st update touched comment and we don't know whether
the 2nd update is the same as the 1st one, unless we iterate over the
list of transaction, which looks a bit overkill? It seems simpler if we
just allow it and accept the last userdata.

I got a question when trying to implementing this. If the update request
specifies USERDATA but its length is 0, do we treat it like not
specified, or remove the existing userdata? Asking because I see
nf_tables_newrule() treats 0 length in the same way as unspecified and
doesn't initialize a nft_userdata. It makes sense for create, but I'm
not sure if it's right to do it in the same way for update. 

And if we want to treat it as "remove comment", we can't simply add a
single pointer of nft_userdata to nft_trans_table to achieve it, because
there would be 3 cases: leave it in place, remove it, update it.

Thanks,
Quan
