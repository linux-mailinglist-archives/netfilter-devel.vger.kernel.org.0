OK, at least it didn't get worse. :)

I looked at the code and it seems you need to implement a 'parse'
callback for struct verdict_type. I guess existing 'parse' callback in
struct integer_type is a good example of how to do it - basically you
need to convert the symbol expression into a constant expression.

Sorry if that's not much help, I'm not really familiar with these
details. :)

Cheers, Phil
