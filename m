The filtering isn't global, its per flow.  Provided
nf_conntrack_events=0, then only flows where the first packet matched
a -j CT rule will generate events, AND only those events that were
specified in its event mask.

So, flows that did not match any CT rule never generate an event, and,
therefore, changes to the kernel should not auto-add the extension for
them.

I don't see how that mechanism can be preserved without the ability to
set nf_conntrack_events=0.

When a new conntrack is generated, the test is (in current kernels):

'add the event cache extension if the template has an event cache
 extension OR if the sysctl is enabled'.

So, changing it to
'add the event cache extension if the template has an event cache
 extension OR if we have a listener' is not the same, unfortunately.

Yes, thats correct, it tells kernel there is an active subscriber for
events.

I can't tell the following two cases apart:

1. templates are active and user wants events ONLY for the chosen flow,
   e.g. tcp.
2. templates are active and user wants only particular events for the
   chosen flows, but all events for the rest.


1) is done by templates + setting the sysctl to 0.
2) is done by templates + setting the sysctl to 1.

With 'assume 1 if listener active', we can only provide functionality of 2).

I finished testing of a prototype and it appears that functionality is ok,
I've pushed this here:
https://git.breakpoint.cc/cgit/fw/nf-next.git/log/?h=nf_ct_events_02

(only the top-most 4 changes are relevant).
