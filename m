Oh, I didn't consider that.

And I didn't know about this either. Well, this looks a bit arbitrary
to me, also because there's no such thing as hash:port,net, so forcing
the left-to-right precedence won't cover all the possible cases anyway.

In nftables, as sets now support an arbitrary number of dimensions, in
an arbitrary order, that would require an explicit evaluation ordering,
which is actually not too hard to implement. I just doubt the usage
would be practical.

As it comes for free, I think it's nice to leave this possibility open
for simple combinations. It doesn't introduce any ambiguity. It's not
an usage I would recommend anyway, but I don't see the harm.

It's actually kind of trivial for nft_set_pipapo, for nft_set_hash it
doesn't apply (it doesn't implement intervals), and I'm not sure about
nft_set_rbtree right now.

However, does this really provide any value compared to having a
separate set for exceptions matched earlier in a chain?

If it really does, I think it could and should be done in userspace by
splitting the intervals. The kernel back-ends shouldn't be overloaded
with complexity that doesn't *need* to live there, and no matter what,
this is going to have a performance impact on the lookup (it should be
doable to avoid an explicit branch for this, but we can't avoid
fetching more bits per element).

Ideally, I would even like to drop the need for timeout and validity
checks as part of the lookup, because they are quite heavy (fetching
the 'extension' pointer, branches, etc.). It involves some internal API
refactoring and is actually on my motionless to-do list, but too far
from the surface to have any practical value.
