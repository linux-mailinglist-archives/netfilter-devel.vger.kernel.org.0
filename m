Yes, I think thats the most straightforward solution.

We can of course also intercept -EAGAIN in nf_tables_api.c and translate
it to -ENOBUFS like in nft_get_set_elem().

But I think a generic solution it better.  The call_rcu backends should
not result in changes to nf_tables internal state so they do not load
modules and therefore don't need a restart.

Right.

Does that SO_RCVBUF succeed? How large is the recvbuf?
We should try to investigate and see that nft works rather than just
fix the loop and claim that fixes the bug (but just changes
'nft loops' to 'nft exits with an error').
