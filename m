Yes. This is typical. "systemctl restart firewalld". This is what's done
on a package update.

It would be nice to eliminate the downtime, yes.

The original intention of CleanupOnExit is to allow shutting down the
daemon while retaining the runtime nftables rules, i.e. zero cost
abstraction.

It would be nice, but not a show stopper.

I'm not concerned with optimizing for the crash case. We wouldn't be
able to make any assumptions about the state of nftables. The only safe
option is to flush and reload all the rules.

Indeed. Always flush at start. Same as after a crash, IMO.

I don't think we need a persist flag. If we want it to persist then
we'll just avoid setting the owner flag entirely.
