Sorry, but I don't get your point. What I meant is that both pool4db
and conntrack are natting machines, so extending conntrack (which is
already integrated in the kernel) with what pool4db does could be a
good way to go.

Anyway, please let me come back to the technical discussion.

Atomic configuration is already supported in nftables and extending
conntrack all the security functionalities and session replication
with conntrackd will be also available.

nft supports maps generation from user space, so something like this
could be configured:

table inet my_table {
    map my_eamt {
        type ipv4_addr : ipv6_addr;
        flags interval;
        elements = { 192.0.2.1/32 : 2001:db8:aaaa::5/128,
                     198.51.100.0/24 : 2001:db8:bbbb::/120,
                     203.0.113.8/29 : 2001:db8:cccc::/125 }
    }
}

And then, use this map to perform the nat rule:

nft add rule inet my_table my_chain snat ip saddr to @my_eamt

Currently, the map structure doesn't work cause the second item should
be a singleton, but probably it can be fixed easily.

My humble opinion is that this model will be hard to accept after the
great efforts done with nftables that joins different commands that
were used in the age of iptables.

My concern is that this can break the normalization of having source
nat in the postrouting instead of in the prerouting phase. Note that
integrating a new feature must ensure not breaking other subsystems.

Cheers.
