Yes, apparently :-/

There are cases where we have a secpath for output, but you can't rely
on it.

I don't mind that change, but we have to be carefull on namespace transition.
xi->net is the namespace 'behind' the xfrm interface. I guess this is the
namespace where you want to do the match because that is the namespace
that has the policies and states for the xfrm interface. So I think that
change is correct, I just wanted to point that out explicitely.
