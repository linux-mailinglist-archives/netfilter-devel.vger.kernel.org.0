Problem is listing is not supported from transaction path, this is
using existing netlink dump infrastructure which runs lockless via
rcu. So we could support reset, but we could not use netlink dump
semantics to fetch the values, and user likely wants this to
fetch-and-reset as in ctnetlink.

We are currently discussing how to implement refresh timeout into the
transaction model.

I would suggest we keep this chunk away by now for the _RESET command,
until we agree on next steps.
