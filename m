Correct, but I think that for performant-sensitive applications, it 
would not be an issue to check sendto and recvfrom for UDP because they 
should use connect/bind and send/recv instead, and we can check 
connect/bind without checking send/recv. Indeed, bind and connect can be 
used to configure an UDP socket, even if it is not a connected protocol 
this enables to limit the number of kernel checks and copies. I'm not 
sure how many applications use sendto and recvfrom though.
