Even if we had those two patches in tree, we would still need
a different userspace syntax for the two cases.

We can't go for

"typeof ip saddr : ct helpername"

because we need to continue to support
ct helper "foo"

So maybe

typeof ip saddr : objref ct helper

Or:

typeof ip saddr : ct helper
flags objref

(Might be able to make this work by internally mangling
 the type after the "objref" flag is found).

Did not recall that.
