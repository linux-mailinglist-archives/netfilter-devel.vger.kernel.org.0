I assumed your intention was for NFTA_HOOK_DEVS to not change
semantically, i.e. remain to contain only devices which are present at
time of the dump. Then I could introduce INACTIVE_DEVS to contain those
we lost meanwhile. As an example:

1) add netdev chain for devices eth0, eth1, eth2
2) list ruleset:
   - HOOK_DEVS = { eth0, eth1, eth2 }
   - INACTIVE_DEVS = {}
3) ip link del eth1
4) list ruleset:
   - HOOK_DEVS = { eth0, eth2 }
   - INACTIVE_DEVS = { eth1 }

This avoids duplicate entries in both lists and thus avoids overhead.
This would fix for the interfaces missing in dumps problem.

Wildcards would appear as-is in either HOOK_DEVS (if there's at least
one matching interface) or INACTIVE_DEVS (if there is none). The actual
list of active interfaces would require a GETDEVICE call.

OK, let's see if I can sum this up correctly:

1) NFTA_HOOK_DEVS is changed to always reflect what the user specified
2) Interfaces being removed or added trigger NEWDEV/DELDEV notifications
3) Active hooks are dumped by GETDEV netlink request
4) NEWDEV/DELDEV netlink requests/responses added to cover for oversized
chains/flowtables

You're saying we have to use (4) for wildcard interfaces, too. Is this
to keep them away from NFTA_HOOK_DEVS? Because in theory 1-3 are
sufficient for wildcards, too.

Ah, I missed that nf_tables_parse_netdev_hooks() merely searches the
current list for duplicate entries, not all chains'/flowtables' ones.

Hmm. I can create multiple netdev chains attaching to the same
interfaces, but only a single flowtable. Is this intentional?
