Yeah, indeed. Let's go ahead and drop all BUG() statements as well.
Seriously, I doubt nftables users agree the software should segfault
instead of aborting with an error message.

Actually, all it takes to notice things don't add up is running the py
testsuite with '-j' arg after adding the obligatory "unit" tests there.
Feel free to search the git history for late additions of .json
callbacks. I think the message is pretty clear.

The clear signal being "oops, my program crashed" when it could be a
dubious "oops, there is no JSON callback for this expression type".
