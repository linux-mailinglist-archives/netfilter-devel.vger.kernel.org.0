This makes sense.

Yes, refresh set element timeout semantics depends on what the timeout
says in the preparation phase. The same problem that is being
discussed in the other two emails in different thread.

We could annotate the current time at the beginning of the
transaction and use it to check if the element has expired, so set
element expiration stops being a moving target.
