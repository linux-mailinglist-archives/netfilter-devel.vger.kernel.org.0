That would make the Landlock interface too complex, we would need a more
generic approach instead e.g. with a single flag.

I agree.  So, with the ability to control socket creation and to also
control listen/bind/connect (and sendmsg/recvmsg for datagram protocols)
we should be good right?

Indeed, and this RFC will not be continued.  We should not think of a
socket as a security object (i.e. a real capability), whereas sockets
are kernel objects used to configure and exchange data, a bit like a
command multiplexer for network actions that can also be used to
identify peers.

Because Landlock is a sandboxing mechanism, the security policy tied to
a task may change during its execution, which is not the case for other
access control systems such as SELinux.  That's why we should not
blindly follow other security models.  In the case of socket control,
Landlock uses the calling task's credential to check if the call should
be allowed.  In the case of abstract UNIX socket control (with Linux
5.12), the check is done on the domain that created the peer's socket,
not the domain that will received the packet.  In this case Landlock can
rely on the peer socket's domain because it is a consistent and
race-free way to identify a peer, and this peer socket is not the one
doing the action.  It's a bit different with non-UNIX sockets because
peers may not be local to the system.
