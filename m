With nftnl_assert() being (shortened):

| #define nftnl_assert(val, attr, expr) \
|  ((!val || expr) ? \
|  (void)0 : __nftnl_assert_fail(attr, __FILE__, __LINE__))

Check for 'expr' (which is passed as 'data_len == sizeof(<something>)')
will only happen if 'val' is not NULL. Callers then return like so:

| return val ? *val : 0;

This means that if you pass an unset attribute to the getter, it will
simply return 0.

Cheers, Phil
