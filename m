Why?  This is hard, the kernel has no notion of data types.

How would this work with ranges or concatenations?

I don't see how its doable.  The lookup key fed to the set lookup
function via nft_lookup.c has a fixed size.

From kernel point of view, its an array of u32 of a given size dictated
by the sets key length.

The kernel doesn't know what an ipv4 or ipv6 address is.
It only knows the total key size.  In case of nft_set_pipapo.c its also
told the sizes of the individual subkeys. (e.g. ipv4_addr .
inet_service -> 4 . 4, ipv6_addr . ip_protocol -> 16 . 4).

Maybe it would be possble to xlate ipv4 addresses to ipv6 mapped
addresses, but that would still require expansion in userland, because

ip saddr @foo
ip6 saddr @foo

cannot work.  We'd need to rewrite it to something like
meta nfproto ipv4 {
	reg32_1 = 0xffffffff
	reg32_2 = 0xffffffff
	reg32_3 = 0xffffffff
	reg32_4 = ip saddr
	lookup @foo sreg32_1
}
meta nfproto ipv6 ip6 saddr @foo

I don't think its worth the pain.  Also because then ipv4 becomes
indistinguishable from on-wire mapped addresses.

There are different sets, yes, but none of these sets support a
particular data type.  They don't know what that is, the datatype is a
userspace thing and its only stored in the kernel so that 'nft list
ruleset' and friends know how to pretty-print the octet soups stored in
the set.  Its not related to matching.
