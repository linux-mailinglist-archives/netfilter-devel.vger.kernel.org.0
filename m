This follows flowtable addition path.

This follows nft_flow_update() path.

I don't see who reports EBUSY at quick glance.

nft_flowtable_update() removes redundant hooks (already registered).

It should not report EBUSY, we have fixed similar issues like this one
in the past.

If you help me narrow down the issue, because I currently do not see
where this EBUSY error originates from.
