For INPUT ipv4 stack will defrag before INPUT hooks are called.

From ipv6 point of view, the ipv6 next header protocol value isn't
relevant at that stage, so it doesn't matter if thats IPPROTO_TCP,
IPPROTO_UDP or, in this case, IPPROTO_FRAGMENT.

INPUT hook runs on the arrived packets, then the packets are delivered
to the next handler, i.e. the fragment-collection done by the IPPROTO_FRAGMENT
handlers is done AFTER the INPUT hook.

To get the behaviour you want you need to enable netfilter ipv6 defrag.

There is currently no way to do this standalone, you will need to add
a dummy tproxy or conntrack rule (the latter will enable conntrack too
which might not be what you want).

Or you modify your ruleset to also queue fragments to userspace and
do ipv6 defrag yourself in the nfqueue application.

Yes, because no ipv6 fragmentation takes place.

Not really, it depends on the protocols involved and the network, think
e.g. of a traffic policier that enforces some rate limit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_offload_engine

But if you are talking about F_GSO flag for nfqueue -- it does NOT
enable GSO, on the contrary.  It tells the kernel "This program
can handle large packets with "bogus" (to-be-filled-by-hardware)
checksum".

Without the flag, tcp packets need to be splitted in software and their
checksums need to be computed too (i.e. all the data needs to be read).

Forgot to mention: in the future when debugging problems, please use
-vvvv (as many as needed), tcpdump elides a lot of information
otherwise.
