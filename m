Hmm, no, because the blob format itself (match, target structures,
ip(6)t_entry have different alignment requirements.

Also, ipt_get_entries has padding on x86_64 in the middle of the
structure that is not there in on i686.

Even the 'compat_to_user' helpers can't be removed because they
are needed by the standard target, see compat_standard_to_user()).

We could simplify things a bit though, if we only consider the matches,
then ebt mark and xt_limit are the only users; at least the xt_match
compat callback could be removed.
