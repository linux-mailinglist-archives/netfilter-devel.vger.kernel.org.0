If i understood correctly Mickaël suggested saving some space for
actions related not only to creating sockets, but also to sending
and receiving socket FDs from another processes, marking pre-sandboxed
sockets as allowed or denied after sandboxing [2]. This may be necessary
in order to achieve complete isolation of the sandbox, which will be
able to create, receive and send sockets of specific protocols.

In future this field may become more generic by including rules for
other entities with similar actions (e.g. files, pipes).

I think it is good approach, but we should discuss this design before
generalizing the name. For now `handled_access_socket` can be a good
name for actions related to accessing specific sockets (protocols).
What do you think?

I have not found any similar features for our case. Do you have any in
mind?

Currently `handled_access_net` stands for restricting actions for
specific network protocols by port values: LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP,
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_SEND_UDP (possibly will be added with UDP feature
[3]).

I dont think that complicating semantics with adding fields for
socket_create()-like actions would fit well here. Purpose of current
patch is to restrict usage of unwanted protocols, not to add logic
to restrict their actions. In addition, it is worth considering that we
want to restrict not only network protocols (e.g. Bluetooth).

I chose rbtree based on the current storage implementation in fs,net and
decided to leave the implementation of better variants in a separate
patch, which should redesign the entire storage system in Landlock
(e.g. implementation of a hashtable for storing rules by FDs,
port values) [4].

Do you think that it is bad idea and more appropriate storage for socket
rules(e.g. what you suggested) should be implemented by current patch?
