You can just leave them as is if this is the way this is exposed in
rules. Not sure what the logic behing -0 and -1 is, this is not
mapping to NFPROTO_* definitions, so it looks like something it's been
pulled out of someone's hat :-)

I think users will end up using --arp and --bridge for this. I myself
will not remember this -0 and -1 thing.

Feel free to explore any possibility, probably leaving the existing -0
and -1 in place if you're afraid of breaking anything, add aliases and
only document the more intuitive one. If you think this is worth
exploring, of course.

Thanks!
