ACK.

We'd optimize for flowtables with many devices. The same system could
also have many flowtables with few devices each, then the hash table
adds to the overhead. A global table for all flowtables could serve
both. We could also have the same device in multiple chains, so each
hash table entry needs a list of ops pointers?

Yes, you're right. Strictly speaking, these events are different from
NFNLGRP_NFTABLES as they don't indicate a ruleset change. Their actual
purpose is to satisfy the requirement of hook reg/unreg being visible to
user space. :)

nft monitor needs some work, though: Right now it's in trace or !trace
mode depending on whether NFT_MSG_TRACE is present in monitor_flags. Now
there will be a third modus operandi. OK, we could hide that internally
and enable the new group automatically if not tracing, then add a
'hooks' keyword so users may 'nft monitor (new|destroy) hooks'.

Cheers, Phil
