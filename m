No resurrection, the element might have counters, it already expired.

Add a new E3. If NLM_F_EXCL is specified, then fail with "does not exist"

We annotate the new timeout in transaction object, then refresh the
timeout update in the commit phase.

You mean, from the preparation phase? Then we need to undo what has
been done, in case of --check / abort path is exercised, this might
just create a bogus element listing.

No need for rollback if new timeout is store in the transaction
object, we just set the new timeout from _commit() step in the
NEWSETELEM case, which has to deal with updates. Other objects follow
a similar approach.
