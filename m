It's a bug in the netlink frontend, which erroneously reports -EAGAIN
to the nfnetlink when the socket buffer is full, see:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20200823115536.16631-1-pablo@netfilter.org/

SO_RCVBUFFORCE fails with EPERM if CAP_NET_ADMIN is not available.

Next problem is to track why socket buffer is getting full with
GET_GENID.

firewalld heavily uses NLM_F_ECHO, there I can see how it can easily
reach the default socket buffer size, but with GET_GENID I'm not sure
yet, probably the problem is elsewhere but it manifests in GET_GENID
because it's the first thing that is done when sending a batch (maybe
there are unread messages in the socket buffer, you might check
/proc/net/netlink to see if the socket buffer keeps growing as
firewalld moves on).

Is this easy to reproduce? Or does this happens after some time of
firewalld execution?
