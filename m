I understand, that would also require some sort of dump of the
parsing, to validate this is correct. I think I understand what you
mean by unit test here: You could make a program that imports this
.c file, the parse pf.os and dump an output that you could validate in
some automated fashion.

This osf support from iptables, and tests/py (which was the automated
test infrastructure it had) was only added 2012, more than 10 years
after iptables was in place.

I see, some internal tests for private API then it is your idea, I am
all in for more test coverage.

Yes, unshare and rootless for tests/py would be good to have if I
understood this correctly.

OK, let's prepare for release then.
