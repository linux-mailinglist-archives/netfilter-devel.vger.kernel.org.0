Subject: [PATCH nft] tests: Introduce test for insertion of overlapping and non-overlapping ranges
Date:   Thu,  5 Mar 2020 21:34:11 +0100
Message-Id: <a0fbd674a9df38fddd9066dd4762d551c207d66a.1583438395.git.sbrivio@redhat.com>

Insertion of overlapping ranges should return success only if the new
elements are identical to existing ones, or, for concatenated ranges,
if the new element is less specific (in all its fields) than any
existing one.

Note that, in case the range is identical to an existing one, insertion
won't actually be performed, but no error will be returned either on
'add element'.

This was inspired by a failing case reported by Phil Sutter (where
concatenated overlapping ranges would fail insertion silently) and is
fixed by kernel series with subject:
	nftables: Consistently report partial and entire set overlaps

With that series, these tests now pass also if the call to set_overlap()
on insertion is skipped. Partial or entire overlapping was already
detected by the kernel for concatenated ranges (nft_set_pipapo) from
the beginning, and that series makes the nft_set_rbtree implementation
consistent in terms of detection and reporting. Without that, overlap
checks are performed by nft but not guaranteed by the kernel.

However, we can't just drop set_overlap() now, as we need to preserve
compatibility with older kernels.
