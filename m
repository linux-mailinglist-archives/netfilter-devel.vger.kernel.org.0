Well, detecting if a string constitutes a valid IP address is rather
trivial. In Python, there's even 'ipaddress' module for that job.

Why is host resolution a problem in such scenario? The fact that using
host names instead of IP addresses may result in significant delays due
to the required DNS queries is pretty common knowledge among system
administrators.

This is just a bug in firewall-cmd, missing to convert ranges into JSON
format. I don't see the benefit for users which no longer may use host
names in that spot.
