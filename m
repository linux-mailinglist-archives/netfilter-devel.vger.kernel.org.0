Concurrent updates are supported, both from user and kernel space.

The operations which would lead to corruption are excluded, like 
destroying the set being dumped or swapping the dumped set with another 
one. A relatively new application of the method is when there's a huge 
add-del operation which must be temporarily halted and the scheduler 
called (so spinlock/mutex cannot be held): for that time destroy/swap must 
also be excluded.

Yes, usually that's the case. However, this code segment triggered me:

That can quite nicely be handled by reference counting the object and 
protecting that way.
