Why?  Userspace has all info: its a tcp option, we have the tcp option
number (mptcp) and a 4 bit field which matches the template field.

There is no guesswork here.

Without this patch, we're asked to find a matching 1-byte field
(which does not exist).

Whats different vs. payload expressions here to require annotations?

No idea, I have not thought about it at all.  I do not want
to add a new data type for this.

One way is to just extend the scanner with even more keywords.
I tought I could annotate the eval context with 'saw mptcp'
and then use that when trying to resolve the symbol expressions.

No idea if that works and no idea how much hassle that is.
