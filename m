That's wrong - sorry. mnl_cb_run() *does* step through the received buffer but
uses the byte count at the front of each message. When there are not enough
unprocessed bytes for another message header (usually there are zero) then it
returns. So there is room to enlarge the packet in the read buffer if it is in
the last (or only) netlink message in that buffer.

In tests I have never seen more than one netlink message returned in the receive
buffer. Even stopping the nfq program with gdb and then sending 10 or so UDP
messges, each call to mnl_socket_recvfrom() only returns a single netlink
message.

If this always happens, there is no need for memcpy() at all. And even if it
doesn't, one could programatically check whether the struct nlmsghdr passed by
queue_cb() is the last in the receive buffer and memcpy() if not.

Any comments?
