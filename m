Agreed. This would be very bad for usability.

How it stands today is exactly as you described above. firewalld relies
on the output (--echo) being in the same order as the input. At the
time, and I think still today, this was the _only_ way to reliably get
the rule handles. It's mostly due to the fact that input != output.

In the past we discussed allowing a user defined cookie/handle. This
would allow applications to perform in a write only manner. They would
not need to parse back the JSON since they already know the
cookie/handle. IMO, this would be ideal for firewalld's use case.
