Yes, every time a new keyword is introduced that list has to be updated.
Right now each introduced keyword may break someone's ruleset. This is
only avoided if that keyword list you propose is constantly kept up to
date.

This is the reason why I prefer to have a more intelligent parser which
just knows where something user-defined is supposed to be and not even
tries to parse it as something it knows.

Ah, I thought that's implied by your mention of a script. If it is
possible, it would at least help keep that list from above up to date.

This topic constantly reminds me of C objects named like their type
'struct foo foo'. That's my personal proof that it must be possible! :)

I didn't check. But I guess the nested syntax (chain within table) is a
problem with my simple "parse two strings now" approach. I would like to
play a bit more with that start condition approach. IMO teaching flex
how to interpret tokens based on earlier ones is a smart way of fixing
it.
