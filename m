iptables-save loops over all tables, and its output can be fed back to
iptables-restore. That has existed for a long time.

Then at some point, -S was added, which is a subset of save-style
output for just one table or chain, but otherwise unchanged. Another
way of looking at it is that the -S command is like -L, but in
re-parsable syntax.

If anything, -L would be deprecated.
