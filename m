Not sure. What does NFTA_HOOK_INACTIVE_DEVS contains? Could you
provide an example? Again, if this array gets again too large, there
could be issues with NLMSG_GOODSIZE again for notifications.

I would just display these active devices (in the list of devices that
are attached to this basechain) via the new command _GETDEV that we
are discussing below? These netdevices that match the pattern come and
go, I guess user only wants to make sure they are actually registered
to this hook for diagnostics, showing an exact match, ie. tap0, or
inexact match, ie. tap* should be should when listing the ruleset IMO.

yes, NFTA_HOOK_DEVS and these new commands need to coexist, there is
no other way to retain backward compatibility.

That's fine.

I prefer future does not bring "enp*s0", but let's agree on an API
that can be extended to accomodate new requirements, that's my only
comment in this regard.

Right.

Yes.

This will also help to remove the existing NFT_NETDEVICE_MAX limit.

That is fine to ensure a given basechain does not have both tap0 and tap*

OK.

Thanks.
