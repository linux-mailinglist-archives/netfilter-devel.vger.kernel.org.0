:) I have been running tests for a while and it seems no more spurious
errors show with:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20230927163937.757167-1-pablo@netfilter.org/

Not related, next one to look at is:

W: [DUMP FAIL]   31/378 testcases/sets/0062set_connlimit

which occasionally fails. This is because this adds an element:

table ip x {
        set est-connlimit {
                type ipv4_addr
                size 65535
                flags dynamic
                elements = { 84.245.120.167 ct count over 20 }
        }
}

the conncount list is empty, then GC might win race to delete this
element with no entries (GC removes empty conncount lists).

I added this test to make sure this restores fine, even if GC removes
all elements that has been restored as soon as it gets a chance to
run, because the conncount list is empty.

For this one, I can set a larger gc-interval, so GC takes longer time
to release it, and still parser coverage for this restoration remains
in place.
