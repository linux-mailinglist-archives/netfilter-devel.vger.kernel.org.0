Yes, that's right.

I reckon they'll just copy the code from the nfq_nlmsg_verdict_put_pkt() man /
web page. After declaring "char pktbuf[plen + EXTRA];" one can use "sizeof
pktbuf" as the length argument.

It has the original 4 from pktb_alloc() plus 2 {buffer, size} pairs. It could
have been just one pair, with packet data appended to metadata as in
pktb_alloc() but I thought it would be really awkward to document how to
dimension it.

I think we should not be usurping the data pointer of mnl_cb_run(). I can see
people wanting to use it to pass a pointer to e.g. some kind of database that
callbacks need to access. There's no performance gain to recycling the buffer:
the CB doesn't need to call pktb_head_size() on every invocation, that can be
done once by main() e.g.

 static size_t sizeof_head;
 ...
 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
 ...
         sizeof_head = pktb_head_size(); /* Avoid multiple calls in CB */
 ...
 static int queue_cb(const struct nlmsghdr *nlh, void *data)
 {
         char head[sizeof_head];

No, there is nothing to release. We told pktb_alloc2() where the buffer was,
it's on the stack (usually).

No way. There is no malloc() nor free() anywhere. The data buffer is
(recommended to be) on the stack; for running under gdb it may be preferred to
us a static buffer which has to be dimensioned hugely.
