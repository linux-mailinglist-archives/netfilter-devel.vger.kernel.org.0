Thanks, Pablo.

It looks like you don't have the 'graphviz' package installed, so there are
lines like

> Collaboration diagram for User-space network packet buffer:

with no diagram.

(e.g. in
https://netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_queue/doxygen/html/group__pktbuff.html).

'graphviz' supplies the 'dot' program which you may have seen doxygen
complaining about. I didn't see the problem originally because I have graphviz
but it didn't come with Slackware so the lack of it may be common.

The fix would be to have config.ac create HAVE_DOT and use that in
doxygen.cfg.in to put YES or NO on the HAVE_DOT and maybe some other lines.

I may tackle that sometime as I gain more confidence with aoutotools.

Cheers ... Duncan.
