We need to rewrite it, its too picky:

nft add rule t c  ip protocol . th dport { tcp . 22, udp . 1  }
nft add rule t c  ip protocol . th dport { tcp / 22, udp . 1  }
nft add rule t c  ip protocol . th dport { tcp / 22 }

In particular, there is a lot of strange code that causes
this to be evaluated in very different ways.
