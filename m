Hi Ryoga,
Thanks for considering my points.

Please, see below for my answers.

No, you cannot rely on this assumption.
Operators can choose to assign different locators to the same node.
The document you mention does not prescribe how the SIDs should be allocated on
the nodes, nor whether they should be part of one or more locators.
Consequently, no one imposes on us that those 100 SIDs must belong all to the
same locator.

Yes, since the SRv6 processing (seg6_local) is applied to traffic with DAs not
necessarily associated with local addresses, it should not pass through INPUT.

Let's consider encap/decap operation. The first important consideration is that
encap and decap are two different beasts.

Encap (T.Encap) is done in seg6_input (seg6_iptunnel) when a packet is
received on the IPv6 receive path and in seg6_output if the packet to be
encapsulated is locally generated.
Then you will have decap operations that are performed in seg6_local, according
to several different decap behaviors.

For the moment, let's consider the encap operation applied to a packet received
on the IPv6 receive path. If your plan is to call NF_HOOK set on OUTPUT, you
will have a similar problem to what I have already described for
seg6_local_input (seg6_local). However, this time the OUTPUT is involved rather
than the INPUT.

The SRv6 encap operation (seg6_input) for packets received on the IPv6 receive
path has been designed and implemented so that packets are not steered through
the OUTPUT. For this reason, if you change this design you will cause: 

 1) possible traffic loss due to some already existing policies in OUTPUT.
    In other words you will break existing working configuration;

 2) a performance drop in SRv6 encapsulation, which I have measured below.

---

I set up a testbed with the purpose of quickly and preliminarily testing the
performance (throughput) of a couple of patched processing functions you
proposed:

  i) SRv6 End (since the seg6_local_input function was patched);

 ii) SRv6 T.Encap (seg6_iptunnel).


The following scenarios were tested:

 1.a) vanilla kernel with a single SRv6 End Behavior and only 1 ip6tables
      (filter) rule to fill the INPUT (although not necessary, see below);
 
 1.b) vanilla kernel with a single SRv6 T.Encap and 0 ip6tables (filter)
      rules on OUTPUT;

 2.a) patched kernel with a single SRv6 End Behavior and only 1 ip6tables
      (filter) rule in INPUT to do accept (necessary to accept the SID);
 
 2.b) patched kernel with a single SRv6 T.Encap and 0 ip6tables (filter)
      rules on OUTPUT.

In 1.a and 2.a, I considered the *ideal* case where we have a single locator
and a single accept rule for the whole locator+SIDs. In the vanilla kernel this
is not necessary, but I wanted to simulate the presence of at least one INPUT
rule in both cases for being as fair as possible.
Indeed, in 2.a the accept rule is mandatory if the default policy in INPUT is
set to drop.

In 1.b and 2.b, I consider a use case where a SRv6 router can generate traffic
(of any kind) to communicate with another node in the network. Although this is
*not* often the case in reality, I considered the *ideal* situation where there
are no restrictions on OUTPUT at all.
However in the real world for case 2.b, we have to consider fixing OUTPUT
policies to handle the IPv6+SRH outer header in case there are some restrictions
on locally generated traffic by the router. Otherwise, this can break
configurations where OUTPUT policies are strict.


Results of tests run in the 4 scenarios:

  Achieved Throughput
  ===================
  1.a) avg. 939.34  kpps, std. dev. 1.09 kpps;
  1.b) avg. 1095.35 kpps, std. dev. 3.64 kpps;
  2.a) avg. 863.07  kpps, std. dev. 1.74 kpps;
  2.b) avg. 924.93  kpps, std. dev. 4.33 kpps.

The changes slowed down performance by about 8.1% in the case of SRv6 End
Behavior and 15.6% in the case of SRv6 T.Encap Behavior.

The performance drop is significant and is always experienced even when we are
not interested in tracking internal packets whatsoever.

I hope I have been of help.

Andrea
