Dear web professional,

We invite you to participate in a research study conducted at Ruhr University Bochum (Germany) in cooperation with Leibniz University Hannover (Germany) and the University of Michigan (USA). We found your email address (netfilter-devel@vger.kernel.org) on the website netfilter.org.

We are interested in understanding how web technologies are integrated into and used by websites. We are looking for perspectives from a wide variety of people working on or with websites, such as developers, content creators, marketing, customer service, legal, and others. Our research relies on the generous help of interested web professionals like you!

This online survey will take about 20-25 minutes to complete.

You are eligible to participate in the study if you

(1) are at least 18 years old,
(2) are involved with websites in some capacity (e. g., their design, development, deployment, maintenance, and / or management), and
(3) are comfortable completing the survey in English.

In case you do not meet these requirements, you can still help us by forwarding this email to someone involved with the website netfilter.org.

Participate!
