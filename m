I believe I was the author of this "for" block.

The intent of V=0 is to hide long build commands and show only the
output name. That works for most people most of the time. It did not
for me in this very build step. ${1}, i.e. the sections, are
dependent on configure options like --disable-ipv4/--disable-ipv6, so
I felt it made sense not only to print the output name (as V=0 does)
but also the source namesâ€”but still not the verbose build command.

With that original goal in mind, silencing echo/printf inside this
recipe, for the usecase of V=0, is incorrect.

[Patches 1 to 6 are fine by me.]
