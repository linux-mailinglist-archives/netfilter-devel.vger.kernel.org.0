Thanks for the summary. Assuming that a blocked commit will only be
postponed until after the current chunk was filled and is being
submitted to user space, I don't see how it would make a practical
difference for reset command if commit_mutex is used instead of
reset_lock (or a dedicated reset_mutex).

Here's a simple repro I use to verify the locking approach (only rule
reset for now):

| set -e
| 
| RULESET='flush ruleset
| table t {
|       chain c {
|               counter packets 23 bytes 42
|       }
| }'
| 
| trap "$NFT list ruleset" EXIT
| for ((i = 0; i < 10000; i++)); do
|       echo "iter $i"
|       $NFT -f - <<< "$RULESET"
|       $NFT list ruleset | grep -q 'packets 23 bytes 42' >/dev/null
|       $NFT reset rules >/dev/null &
|       pid=$!
|       $NFT reset rules >/dev/null
|       wait $!
|       #$NFT list ruleset | grep 'packets'
|       $NFT list ruleset | grep -q 'packets 0 bytes 0' >/dev/null
| done

If the two calls clash, the rule will have huge counter values due to
underflow.
