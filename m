Yes, but to maintain the hashtable, we need to bother the "normal" code path 
with hash_add/del. Not much, but still, some overhead...

Yes, a full spectrum of batching methods are possible. If we're to minimize the 
number of bytes crossing the kernel/user boundary though, an array of ids looks 
like the way to go (4 bytes per packet, assuming uint32 ids).

For O(1) lookup:

My primary motivation is for transparent proxies and userland qdiscs. In both 
cases, specific packets must be held for some time and reinjected at a later 
time which is not computed by a simple, fixed delay, but rather triggered by 
some external event.

My secondary motivation is that the netfilter queue is a beautifully 
asynchronous mechanism, and absolutely nothing in its definition limits it to 
the dumb FIFO-of-instantaneous-drop-decisions that seems to dominate sample code.

For the deprecation of id-range-based batching:

It seems that as soon as two different packet streams are muxed in the queue, 
one deserving verdict A and the other verdict B, contiguous id ranges of a given 
verdict may be very small. But I realize I'm 20 years late to complain :)

That being said, the Doxygen of the userland nfqueue API mentions being 
DEPRECATED... So what is the recommended replacement ?
