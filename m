Thanks!

I didn't count the number of commands, but highly doubt it was even
close to 3000.

Highly appreciated. Put me in Cc and I'll stress-test it a bit.

The discussion that led to NLM_F_ECHO was to support atomic rule handle
retrieval. A user-defined "pseudo-handle" obviously can't uphold that
promise and therefore won't be a full replacement.

Apart from that, JSON echo output in it's current form is useful for
scripts to retrieve the handle. We've had that discussion already, I
pointed out they could just do 'input = output' and know
'input["nftables"][5]["add"]["rule"]["expr"][0]["match"]["right"]' is
still present and has the expected value.

I recently found out that firewalld (e.g.) doesn't even do that, but
instead manually iterates over the list of commands it got back and
extracts handle values. Doing that without NLM_F_ECHO but with cookies
instead means to add some rules, then list ruleset and search for one's
cookies.

That aside, if nftables doesn't support cookies beyond keeping them in
place, why not just use a custom comment instead? That's even
backwards-compatible.

Cheers, Phil
