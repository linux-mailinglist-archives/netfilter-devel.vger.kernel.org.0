Another way of shortly describing it, considering the software fastpath,
only there it is a problem:

Same case #1:
When looking at the ingress hook of the fastpath for a bridged
switchdev-port (non-dsa) with PVID set, the existing code is written so
that the flowtuple needs to match the packet INcluding the PVID.

Same case #2:
When considering the ingress hook of the fastpath of a bridged device
that is not part of a switchdev at all and there is no dsa on the bridge
(so it is not a foreign device), the existing code is written so that
the flowtuple needs to match the packet EXcluding the PVID.

When looking at the diagram of this patch, wlan1 would stand for any
foreign device. Because of the use of BR_VLFLAG_ADDED_BY_SWITCHDEV, case
#1 is applied, instead of case #2.

I've only setup the bridged part with systemd-networkd. When trying to
re-create, it will only happen if the total action of the bridge,
towards the foreign port, is:

ingress + egress = untagging

So in the forward-fastpath, tagging in the forward path is done by a
vlan-device and untagging is done in the forward path of the bridge.

> With respect to the patch you've posted, it doesn't look exactly great.

Agreed. I was experimenting now with having br_switchdev_port_vlan_add()
first to try it only for non-foreign ports. If not successful, then try
it with foreign ports. This way the calling function will know if the
port is a foreign port. Therefore, no need for the switchdev driver to
communicate back to upper layers.

The entire usage BR_VLFLAG_ADDED_BY_SWITCHDEV does need a careful review.

I also realize my patch-set needs to do more with the switchdev and vlan
combination, then it does now. So for now I will leave it as RFC, as it
will not work properly with switchdevs other the dsa.
