Thanks Dan.  If I pulled this into a branch and built you some test
kernels to play with, any idea how long it might take to get a proof
of concept working on the cri-o side?

FWIW, I've also reached out to some of the LXC folks I know to get
their take on the API.  I think if we can get two different container
runtimes to give the API a thumbs-up then I think we are in good shape
with respect to the userspace interface.

I just finished looking over the last of the pending audit kernel
patches that were queued waiting for the merge window to open so this
is next on my list to look at.  I plan to start doing that
tonight/tomorrow, and as long as the changes between v5/v6 are not
that big, it shouldn't take too long.
