Thanks for explaining, so this is resulting from lack of consistency
in the cache handling.

We can set the generation ID of reference that is used for this batch,
the kernel then bails out with ERESTART so we can rebuild the cache.

However, I think the problem with the index is that it is unreliable
itself for concurrent updates. In that case the rule handle should be
used.

That would be great.

I'm going to send a v2 for:

http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1110586/

addressing your feedback, then you can rebase on top.

Thanks!
