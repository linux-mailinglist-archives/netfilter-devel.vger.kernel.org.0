...what a mess. I could figure that part out (it was a case symmetric
to what this patch fixed, in this case resolving to case b5.) but
there's then another case (found by triggering a specific tree topology
with 0044interval_overlap_1) where we first add a start element, then
fail to add the end element because the start element is completely
"hidden" in the tree by inactive nodes.

I tried to solve that with some backtracking, but that looks also
fragile. If I clean up the tree before insertion, instead, that will
only deal with expired nodes, not inactive nodes -- I can't erase
non-expired, inactive nodes because the API expects to find them at
some later point and call nft_rbtree_remove() on them.

Now I'm trying another approach that looks more robust: instead of
descending the tree to find overlaps, just going through it in the same
way nft_rbtree_gc() does (linearly, node by node), marking the
value-wise closest points from left and right _valid_ nodes, and
applying the same reasoning. I need a bit more time for this, but it
looks way simpler. Insertion itself would keep working as it does now.

In hindsight, it looks like it was a terrible idea to try to fix this
implementation. I really underestimated how bad this is. Functionally
speaking, it's not a red-black tree because:

- we can't use it as a sorted binary tree, given that some elements
  "don't matter" for some operations, or have another colour. We might
  try to think of it as some other structure and rebuild from there
  useful properties of sorted binary trees, but I'm not sure a
  "red-brown-black" tree would have any other use making it worth of
  any further research

- end elements being represented as their value plus one also break
  assumptions of sorted trees (this is the issue I'm actually facing
  with backtracking)

- left subtrees store keys greater than right subtrees, but this
  looks consistent so it's just added fun and could be fixed
  trivially (it's all reversed)

By the way, I think we _should_ have similar issues in the lookup
function. Given that it's possible to build a tree with a subtree of at
least three levels with entirely non-valid nodes, I guess we can hide a
valid interval from the lookup too. It's just harder to test.

In the perspective of getting rid of it, I think we need:

1. some "introductory" documentation for nft_set_pipapo -- I just
   got back to it (drawing some diagrams first...)

2. to understand if the performance gap in the few (maybe not
   reasonable) cases where nft_set_rbtree matches faster than
   nft_set_pipapo is acceptable. Summary:
     https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/be7d4e51603633e7b88e4b0dde54b25a3e5a018b.1583598508.git.sbrivio@redhat.com/

3. a solution for https://bugzilla.netfilter.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1583,
   it's an atomicity issue which has little to do with nft_set_pipapo
   structures themselves, but I couldn't figure out the exact issue
   yet. I'm struggling to find the time for it, so if somebody wants to
   give it a try, I'd be more than happy to reassign it...

Anyway, I'll post a different patch for nft_set_rbtree soon.
