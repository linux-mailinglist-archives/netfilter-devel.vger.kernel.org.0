Sure, the functionality is to fetch old values while resetting so they
are not lost (and may be used for accounting, etc.). The question is
what we want to guarantee. There's still the non-dump path, so if
someone wants transactional safety they could still reset rules
individually.

The whole "what if my other hand pulls the trigger while I'm still
drawing the gun" scenario is a bit too academic for my taste. ;)

Make them inactive and free only after the dump is done? IIUC,
nft_active_genmask() will return true again though after the second
update, right?
