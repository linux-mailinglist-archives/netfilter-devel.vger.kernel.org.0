You could also integrate the tcpdr tool that Mate was using to test
tproxy, there will be a test for tproxy too at some point, right? And
you don't want to push that into the kernel?

Having all this testing tools in the git repository somewhere where it
can be collected could be useful. Users could invoke it from command
line to collect packets and print them. I mean, add the nfqueue tool,
then the nflog tool too, and so on.

It would be also a good way to keep the C code for these tooling in
the netfilter tree, while keeping the shell scripts in the kernel
tree.
