I agree, in dedicated setup there's no need for compromises. I guess if
you manage to reduce ruleset changes to mere set element modifications,
you could outperform iptables in that regard. Run-time performance of
the resulting ruleset will obviously benefit from set/map use as there
are much fewer rules to traverse for each packet.

Thanks! I'm also interested in seeing whether there are any
inconveniences due to nftables limitations. Maybe some problems are
easier solved on kernel-side.

Cheers, Phil
