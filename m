Yes, sorry.

Apologies, I will rephrase it.

Yes, I don't think we ever have a duplicate to begin with, insert path
returns -EEXIST or ignores the insertion request.

They exist in the clone/copy for the case when one transaction asked for
remoal of "e" (and marks it as invalid in new generation) followed by
a re-insert of "e".

In that case, The "e" re-insert should find and skip the old result
and continue to search for a matching result.

Thats also what the test case does:
insert e
<end of transaction>
flush set x <mark e invalid>
insert e    <find e-old, continue search, find no result>, insert ok
insert e    <find e-old, continue search, find e-new, fail transaction

I think I'll extend the test case to also check that "flush set x;
insert e" works on a set that already contained e before.

Nope, that doesn't work.  If you reset rp = key, it fixes the splat
but results in infinite loop.

Note last sentence, its important the bitmap is toggled to off in the
"last" case so the next attempt won't result in rediscovery of that
element.

After this patch, the sequence is: (in case you have key matching both e1
and e2):

	1. find e1, test, expired -> call pipapo_refill
       	2. find e1 again, expired -> call pipapo_refill
        3. find e2, test, valid -> return e2 as matching entry

without this patch, its:
	find e1, test, expired -> goto next (restart loop)
	find no matching entry (rp not reset so its searching for
	something else)
	-> duplicate insertion passes as e2 not be found

with full restart but fixed rp assignment:
	1) find e1, test, expired -> reset key
        2) goto 1

... so i opted for the first solution.
For the packet path, the "pipapo_refill" call will happen when
the element is expired (timed out).
I don't see many users mixing pipapo entries with timeouts.

I have to resend anyway so I will fix this up, thanks.
