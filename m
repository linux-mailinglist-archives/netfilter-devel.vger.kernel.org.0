I would like it considered for merging if you think it will be required
to provide enough information about the event that happenned.  In the
bpf unload case, there is a program number to provide a link to a
previous load action.  In this case, we won't know for sure what caused
the table to be unloaded if the number of entries was empty.  I'm still
trying to decide if it matters.  For the sake of caution I think it
should be included.  I don't like it, but I think it needs to be
included.
