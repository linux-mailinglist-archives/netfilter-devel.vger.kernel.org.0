IIRC, it allows to filter what events are of your interest in a global
fashion.

Are you sure? -j CT sets on the event mask. The explicit -j CT rules
means userspace want to listen to events, but only those that you
specified. So it is the same as having a userspace process to listen,
but the global filtering applies.

My understanding is that the listen-count tells that packets should
follow ct netlink event path.

What am I missing?

It won't be flexible enough for all usecases. The ct event filter from
rule is global.

Let me know,
