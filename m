It is possible to filter 100 SIDs with one single rule and one set,
even if they are different SIDs.

If this is a real concern, then it should be to possible to add new
hooks such as NF_INET_LWT_LOCAL_IN and NF_INET_LWT_LOCAL_OUT, and extend
conntrack to also register handlers for those new hooks.

This is not correct, you are evaluating here the cost of the
filtering, not the cost of the new hooks. If your concern that the new
hooks might slow down the IPv6 SRv6 datapath, then you should repeat
your experiment with and without the patch that adds the hooks.

And you should also provide more information on how you're collecting
any performance number to allow us to scrutinize that your performance
evaluation is correct.

Thanks.
