We're drifting into downstream details here, but I agree that we should
have nftables-service(s) RPM which is not installed by default.

Probably, yes. Tables only separate name spaces, though. The actual
merge points are the netfilter hooks and tables don't matter there. The
problem of rule ordering in a builtin iptables chain has become a
problem of base chain ordering in a hook. Eventually rules are
serialized and since one can't undo an earlier drop/reject, there's
still room for conflicts. Real concurrent use therefore requires a
mediating agent like firewalld and a more abstract language than "accept
this, drop that".

Since tables are bound to an IP version (or "inet"), a single table may
or may not suffice for users. Apart from that, one may even do:

| ExecStart=nft 'add table firewall { include "/etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf"; }'

One can't dump the current ruleset into that file anymore, though.

Anyway, I think we're playing hide'n'seek here: Even if nftables service
sticks to a given (set of) table(s), base chains may easily break k8s.
Marking the two as conflicting with systemd is a better choice IMO.

Cheers, Phil
