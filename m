	The estimation can take long time when using
multiple IPVS rules (eg. millions estimator structures) and
especially when box has multiple CPUs due to the for_each_possible_cpu
usage that expects packets from any CPU. With est_nice sysctl
we have more control how to prioritize the estimation
kthreads compared to other processes/kthreads that
have latency requirements (such as servers). As a benefit,
we can see these kthreads in top and decide if we will
need some further control to limit their CPU usage (max
number of structure to estimate per kthread).
