I suppose you're doing something like:

nft add table x
nft add set x k '{ type ipv4_addr . ipv4_addr ; flags interval ; }'
nft add element x k { 1.1.1.1-2.2.2.2 . 3.3.3.3 }
nft add element x k { 1.1.1.1-2.2.2.3 . 3.3.3.3 }

in which case, yes, this is exactly the problem reported by Phil and my
point below: nft_pipapo_insert() reports -EEXIST on the second element,
but it's cleared by nft_add_set_elem().

It doesn't for me:

# nft add table x
# nft add set x z '{ type ipv4_addr ; flags interval ; }'
# nft add element x z { 1.1.0.0-1.1.2.254 }
# nft add element x z { 1.1.0.0-1.1.2.254 }
# echo $?
0

that is, -EEXIST from nft_rbtree_insert() is also cleared by
nft_add_set_elem(). Am I trying it in a different way?

It does, the overlapping (entire or partial) is detected and
nft_pipapo_insert() reports -EEXIST.

It's doable, the problem is that with multiple ranges as different
fields of single elements it might be ambiguous for which fields
merging should be attempted.

That is, in the '{ 20-30 . 40-50, 25-35 . 45-50 }' case below, should I
attempt merging 0, 1 or 2 fields? I think the 'automerge' feature would
be even more confusing here, assuming it can be defined at all.

Yes, I also think so, and nft_pipapo_insert() reports that.

So you're suggesting that I change nft_add_set_elem() like this:

@@ -5075,8 +5075,6 @@ static int nft_add_set_elem(struct nft_ctx *ctx, struct nft_set *set,
                             nft_set_ext_exists(ext2, NFT_SET_EXT_OBJREF) &&
                             *nft_set_ext_obj(ext) != *nft_set_ext_obj(ext2)))
                                err = -EBUSY;
-                       else if (!(nlmsg_flags & NLM_F_EXCL))
-                               err = 0;
                }
                goto err_element_clash;
        }

?
