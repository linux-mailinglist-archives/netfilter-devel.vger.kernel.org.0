Yes, those two are equivalent.

tcp flag syn

is a shortcut to match on the syn bit regarless other bit values, it's
a property of the bitmask datatypes.

tcp flags == syn

is an exact match, it checks that the syn bit is set on.

these two above are equivalent, I just sent a patch to fix the
tcp flags & syn == syn case.

The most simple way to express this is: tcp flags == syn.

Yes, those two are equivalent. This is the same example as the one you
have used at the beginning of this email.

That's equivalent to:

tcp flags fin,syn,ack

A quick summary:

- If you want an exact match:

tcp flags == fin,syn,ack

- If you want to check that those three bits are set on (regardless
  the remaining bits):

tcp flags fin,syn,ack / fin,syn,ack

- If you want to check that any of these three bits is set on:

tcp flags fin,syn,ack

tcp flags & (fin | syn | ack) != 0 is checking for any of these three
bits to be set on, this translation is correct.
