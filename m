The intent of this code is to check that each cpu went through a phase where the seq was even at least once.

This would loop possibly more times, since you exit if the count is _currently_ even.
 
If we are unlucky this could loop for a very long time.

4.19 has many bugs really. Please upgrade to v4.19.83
