I just took the bare minimum of this patch to provide more control on
memory management as you request, it is here:

http://git.netfilter.org/libnetfilter_queue/commit/?id=91d2c947b473b3540be5474c7128a5fa4ce60934

I have removed the extra callback wrapper which does not provide much
but an extra layer to the user.

Please, do not pursue this approach, this pkt_buff structure is
mocking the sk_buff API in the kernel in a very simplistic way. You
can still implement such tunnel handling in your application.

Thanks.
