Sounds like a nice approach! So I would add a new
NFTNL_EXPR_LOOKUP_SET_PTR to link the set and introduce
NFTA_LOOKUP_ANON_SET (or so) which starts a nested attribute filled
simply by nftnl_set_nlmsg_build_payload()? Kernel code would have to be
extended accordingly, of course.

Seems like I can't reuse nftnl_set_nlmsg_parse() since
mnl_attr_parse_nested() would have to be called. But I guess outsourcing
the attribute handling from the further and introducing a second wrapper
would do.

Also, this would limit ebtables-nft among match to kernels supporting
this new way of anon set creating.

Luckily, in kernel space it seems like anonymous sets are released
automatically if the referencing rule is removed.

Cheers, Phil
