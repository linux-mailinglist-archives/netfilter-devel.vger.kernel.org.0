This is useful in case one wants different treatments for packets
according to a number of thresholds in different rules. For example,

    iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set c src --bytes-lt 100 -j noise
    iptables -I noise -m set --match-set c src --bytes-lt 20000 -j download

and you want to log packets from chains 'noise' and 'download' with
different prefixes.

With 10GbE, 64-bit counters can cover more than:
  2 ^ 64 / (10 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 / 8) = 14757395259 seconds
that is,
  14757395259 / (60 * 60 * 24) = 170803 days
that is,
  170803 / 365 = 468 years

...is that a real issue?

Well, but for that, iptables/x_tables counters are available and
(as far as I know) typically used.
