I don't really see how.  Empty ruleset with single

'ct count over 3 reject'

... is broken flat out broken. I mean, whats that supposed to do?

1st connection comes in -> 1
2nd connection comes in -> 2
3rd connection comes in -> 3
4th connection comes in -> 4 -> rejects happen (for all matching _packets_!)

The extra gc doesn't change anything here except that when one
connection has closed this gets 'healed'.  But I argue that this is
nonsensical ruleset, given the connection has to time out (even fin/rst etc.
won't pass, so normal closing possible).

If we look at a better example:

ct state new ct count over 3 reject
(or same as before but with earlier 'ct state established accept'):

1st connection comes in -> 1
..
4th connection comes in -> 4 -> new connection attempt gets rejected

... some connection closes ...

-> next connection attempt passes, as one entry is reaped and replaced
with another one.

Can you describe a sane failing case?
It should be in a comment if we need to retain the else branch since I
can't come up with a single example of where its needed.
