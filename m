Hmm. Maybe I miss something, I just noticed that json_print_echo()
doesn't make use of json_root anymore.

We agreed that regular nft output is made for humans, not machines.
Hence why we have libnftables and JSON API. Very simple scripts may get
by with regular output, grepping for 'handle <NUM>' and ignoring the
rest. When loading more than a single command, this quickly becomes
inconvenient.

The less predictable echo output behaves, the harder it is to write code
that makes use of it. The whole handle semantics assumes scripts will be
able to fetch handles from echo output. With output being identical to
input apart from added handles, scripts may just replace their input
with received output and will find everything where it is supposed to
be. The alternative means extracting handles from output and updating
the stored input based on array indexes. Basically libnftables does this
updating for users as a service, and the code in commit 50b5b71ebeee3
("parser_json: Rewrite echo support") is probably more efficient than
what any Python script could do.

Maybe I am over-estimating the importance of handle usability. The fact
that people have to use a rule's handle in order to remove it means to
me that they will either find a way to get the handle of the rule they
added or fall back into a write-only usage-pattern which means dropping
the whole chain/table/ruleset for each change. Basically what iptables
does internally.

I'm assuming scripts will work directly with the Python data structures
that are later passed to libnftables as JSON. If they want to change a
rule, e.g. add a statement, it is no use if other statements disappear
or new ones are added by the commit->retrieve action.

Maybe Eric can shed some light on how Firewalld uses echo mode and
whether my concerns are relevant or not.

Cheers, Phil
