The context here is in OpenWrt, 
https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/beeb49740bb4. The use of 
/bin/bash is a problem during a cross build of libmnl, with a build system 
running macOS or BSD. /bin/bash on macOS is an unsuitably old version, and 
the OpenWrt build ensures that a recent bash is available in PATH. BSD 
derivatives tend not to have /bin/bash at all, although bash may be 
present elsewhere in PATH. Again, the OpenWrt build ensures this.

I would not expect the same treatment to be strictly necessary for scripts 
like libnetfilter_queue or libnetfilter_log, which run on the target 
system, but the reliance on /bin/bash is a problem for cross builds and in 
particular non-Linux build systems. Considering that these cross builds 
are otherwise perfectly clean given an appropriate toolchain, it seems 
unnecessary to leave them broken for something like this, when a simple 
reliance on locating bash via PATH ought to suffice for everyone.

Mark
