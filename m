OK, thanks for the clarification.

The reported use-case is a match against tunnel data in output hook:

| table t {
|     chain c {
|         type filter hook output priority filter
|         oifname eth0 ipsec out ip daddr 192.168.1.2
|     }
| }

The ipsec expression tries to extract that data from skb_dst(skb)->xfrm
if present. In xt_policy (for iptables), code is equivalent. The above
works when not using xfrm_interface. Initially I assumed one just needs
to adjust the oifname match, but even dropping it doesn't help.

Cheers, Phil
