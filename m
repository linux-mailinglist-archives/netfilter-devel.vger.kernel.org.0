I'm in the middle of building patches 1/3 and 2/3, assuming all goes
well I'll merge them into audit/next (expect mail soon), however I'm
going back and forth on this patch.  Like you I kinda don't like it,
and with both of us not in love with this patch I have to ask if there
is certification requirement for this?  I know about the generic
subj/obj requirements, but in the case where there is no associated
task/syscall/etc. information it isn't like the extra fields supplied
in this patch are going to have much information in that regard; it's
really the *absence* of that information which is telling.  Which
brings me to wonder if simply the lack of any associated records in
this event is enough?  Before when we weren't associating records into
a single event it would have been a problem, but the way things
currently are, if there are no other records (and you have configured
that) then I think you have everything you need to know.

Thoughts?
