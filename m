Hi,

I am sorry for the trouble that my change has caused. I do not know
what the correct action would be, but I am just trying to figure out
what is going on. In your first email, you wrote:

> but 0.

I might be a bit slow, but I have some trouble understanding this
sentence. Is what you are saying that software that sets version to
anything but 0 breaks? According to the discussion triggered by the
patch adding the feature that we fix here (see the thread [PATCH
07/31] netfilter: ctnetlink: Support L3 protocol-filter on flush),
using the version field is the correct solution. Pablo wrote:

So I guess Nicholas worry was correct, that there are applications
that leave version uninitialized and they trigger the regression. I
will let others decide if not setting version counts as a regression
or incorrect API usage. If an uninitialized version counts as a
regression, I am fine with reverting and will try to come up with
another approach. However, I guess we now might have users that depend
on the new behavior of flush as well.

BR,
Kristian
