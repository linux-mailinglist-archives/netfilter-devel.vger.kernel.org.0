Still some issues here running conntrack-tools/tests/conntrack/test-conntrack.c
with your patch v5 on top of nf-next, it reports:

        OK: 84 BAD: 38

it should say:

        OK: 122 BAD: 0

The test this needs to be compiled via:

        gcc -lnetfilter_conntrack test-conntrack.c -o test

I'm attaching the log for the run of your patch v5.

Have a look at the "BAD" pattern which provides tells what conntrack
command stopped working.

Thanks for working on this.
