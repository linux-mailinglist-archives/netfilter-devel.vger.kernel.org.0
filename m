dnatting twice is required to deal with the conntrack confirmation race.

packet 1 enters prerouting, dnat is done using IP A as destination
packet 2 enters prerouting, dnat is done using IP B as destination
packet 1 is enqueued to userspace from postrouting, with unconfirmed conntrack
packet 2 is enqueued to userspace from postrouting, with unconfirmed conntrack
packet 1 is reinjected back to kernelspace from postrouting, conntrack
is confirmed, it uses IP A as destination.
*packet 2* is reinjected back to kernelspace from postrouting, ct lookup
tells us packet lost race, unconfirmed conntrack is dropped, update
mangling to use IP A for consistency (because packet 2 is using IP).

So far we have been assuming races with conntrack confirmation are
unlikely, thus, this is scenario is handled as a corner case which
requires this double mangling.

You still see packets being dropped, right? That should not happen,
I might be then missing something else because my patch triggers also
a re-routing which is required because packet 2 was finally mangled
to use IP A while route still points to IP B.
