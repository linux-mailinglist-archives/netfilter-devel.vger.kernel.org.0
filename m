I agree this field is not commonly used, so might not be that useful.
In most cases, the protocol field will just be 0.

One case I thought of previously is building an icmp or DHCP packet
with raw socket,  but now I'm not sure what kind of support/enforce
the kernel has for the protocol field with raw socket.

We can drop this for now, if there is a clearer requirement in future,
it is easy to add a new rule.
