Ok, my point of view has changed. Sorry; I'm trying to reconcile the
interests of different parties.

Here's the thing:

Creating a bridge between nftables and Jool, and merging Jool into
nftables, are (from my perspective) separate tasks. The former is
simple, the latter is longterm. My current pull request attempts to
address the former, but not the latter.

The former task is [0], and the latter is [1].

According to Jool's feature survey ([2]), a majority of my opinionated
users want the nftables/Jool bridge, another majority wants me to
implement MAP-T. Unfortunately, I lack the number of users who want me
to perform a formal merge between nftables and Jool, but I presume
that it has diminished ever since Jool was packaged for different
distributions. (Since installation is no longer a daunting task.)

However, I do acknowledge that merging Jool into nftables is the right
course of action, and I would like to commit in this direction.

So I propose the following order of events:

1. Merge the bridge into nftables. This will give a temporary early
solution for those who want it.
2. Implement MAP-T.
3. Merge Jool into nftables.
4. Deprecate the bridge, and eventually remove it.

Is this an acceptable compromise?

Alberto
