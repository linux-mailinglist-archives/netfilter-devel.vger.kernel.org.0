ipfix, gprint, oprint and the SQL plug-ins all assume that input keys of
type ULOGD_RET_IPADDR are ipv4.  There is a separate ipv6 adddress type
(ULOGD_RET_IP6ADDR), but it is not used anywhere.

The question is what to do with ipv6 addresses on output, in particular
for the DB plug-ins where trying to write 128 bit values into possibly
32 bit columns might cause errors.  In the current version of the patch,
the gprint and oprint plug-ins are updated to output ipv6 addresses
correctly, the DB plug-ins replace the value with null, and I didn't fix
the ipfix plug-in.

As it happens, the mysql and pgsql schemas in doc/ should be fine, but
the sqlite3 one won't be.  My current thinking is to add a boolean
config setting to the SQL plug-ins to indicate whether the DB schema
can accommodate ipv6 addresses.

The problem is that it isn't always possible to tell.  Consider a stack
with an NFLOG source.  The address family will depend on the family of
the table containing the rule outputting to the log, which is not
visible to ulogd.

Having revisited this work, I think my blithe assumption that I could
fix the handling of ipv6 addresses and the original endianness problem
in one patch may have been overly optimistic. :) In the next version, I
will separate the changes to keep ipv4 addresses in NBO from the ipv6
fixes.

Florian's observation about the ambiguity between real mapped ipv4
addresses and the synthetic ones created by this patch has prompted me
to revisit my approach to the ipv6 fixes.  My current thinking is to use
the `len` field of `struct ulogd_key` to keep track of the size of the
address: 4 =3D ipv4, 16 =3D ipv6.
