Actually ... yes :/

I had hoped that we could maximize coverage of netfilter core infra
this way.

We have an embarassing number of regressions and really stupid bugs.
Largely because we don't have tests at all, or because they
live outside of kernel/are not run with a certain config.

Yes, but that means that anyone running make run_tests will get a 'SKIP'
for these tests UNLESS they also installed the netfilter-test.git
tools.

If you think thats fine, I can start accumulating tools in a new repo.
