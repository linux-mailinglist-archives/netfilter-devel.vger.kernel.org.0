There is an independent fixup shell script at v4

Please do not wait for this to happen. As I gain familiarity with autotools,
there will be more and more incremental updates.

So you can review them easily, I'll try to keep each patch doing just one thing.
But that means more patches, so can you just apply one of the patch series so we
don't get too far behind?

Here's a possible mechanism, but it needs there to be a new netfilter git
project: how would you be with that?

 - autogen.sh does `git clone libnetfilter_doc`
 - autogen.sh distributes the files(*) in libnetfilter_doc to wherever they go
   in the current source tree
 - autogen.sh deletes libnetfilter_doc/

This approach has the advantage that `make distcheck` tarballs are complete,
i.e. don't require a working network to build.

For best results, update doxygen comments in the source to contain SYNOPSIS
sections.

(*) as well as build_man.sh, most of configure.ac is boilerplate and could be
encapsulated in 1 or more m4 macros to reside in libnetfilter_doc. Also most of
doxygen.cfg.in could go there, with local variations in doxygen.cfg.local (at
least EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS, maybe nothing else).

Cheers ... Duncan.
