Restriction are applied to actions, not to already existing/opened FDs. 
We could add a way to restrict opened FDs, but I don't think this is the 
right approach because sandboxing is a deliberate action from a process, 
and it should already take care of its FDs.

seccomp restricts the use of the syscall interface, whereas Landlock 
restricts the use of kernel objects (i.e. the semantic).

We need to find a good tradeoff between a lot of access rights and a few 
grouping different actions. This should make sense from a developer 
point of view according to its knowledge and use of the kernel 
interfaces (potential wrapped with high level libraries), but also to 
the semantic of the sandbox and the security guarantees we want to provide.

We should also keep in mind that high level Landlock libraries can take 
care of potential coarse-grained use of restrictions.

Right, seccomp cannot filter TCP ports.

Good point. I think it is in line with the rule definition: to allow to 
bind on a specific port. However, if clients want to set the source port 
to a (legitimate) value, then that would be an issue because we cannot 
allow a whole range of ports (e.g., >= 1024). I'm not sure if this 
practice would be deemed "legitimate" though. Do you know client 
applications using bind?

Konstantin, we should have a test for this case anyway.

I don't get the semantic of LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_PROTOCOL. What does 
PROTOCOL mean?
