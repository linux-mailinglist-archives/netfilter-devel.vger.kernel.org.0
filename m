I consider the first paragraph as a problem statement for this patch.
According to linux recommendations problem should be established before
the description of changes. Do you think that the changes part should
stand before the problem anyway?

Thanks, lets take this one.

Should I send it after this patchset would be accepted?

Yeap. There is probably a missing reference to the corresponding network
stack code (inet_csk_listen_start()). I'll add it.

ULP can be used in the context of TCP protocols as an additional layer
(currently supported only by IP and MPTCP), so it cannot be recognized
with family or type. You can check this test [1] in which TCP IP socket
is created with ULP control hook.

Yeah, MPTCP protocol for example (see net/mptcp/subflow.c). ULP control
hook is supported only by IP and MPTCP, and in both cases
clone method is checked during listen(2) execution.

bind(2) and connect(2) hooks also support AF_UNSPEC family, so I think
such helper is gonna complicate code a little bit. Also it can
complicate switch in current_check_access_socket().
