They aren't really useful here.  I was hoping to remove them given your
reasoning, but I was having trouble guessing what you wanted even after
asking for clarity.  Can you clarify what you would prefer to see in
this patch?  I was hoping to skip this extra patch revision which took
longer than hoped due to trying to guess what you wanted while working
yesterday during a public holiday to get this patch out in time for the
merge window.

A UID of 0="root" is really a bit misleading since while it is the most
trusted user running the most privileged level, the event wasn't
triggered by a user.  It is the default value of that field.  I did
think aloud that uid could be set by the kernel to run under a
particular user's id (like a daemon dropping capabilities and switching
user after setup to limit abuse), but the kernel is just a tracker for
these IDs and doesn't really know what they mean other than root.  I saw
no reply to that idea.  It was set to "root" which isn't unset or
unexpected, but granted is useless in this case.

You had offered that keeping auid was a concession to Steve so I kept it
in since I had the impression that is what you wanted to see.  That
explanation seems pretty thin to include in a patch description if what
you are getting at in your sentence above.

I am willing to purge both if that is what you would prefer to accept in
the patch.
