Agreed.

I don't need this myself. I just found this bugzilla ticket while
reviewing recent reports. I think my patch for conntrack command line
is fine by now (documentation plus deal with corner case that triggers
ENOSPC from update path).

So yes, agreed, if anyone has a use case for no rules while having
connlabel, they should come here and explain.
