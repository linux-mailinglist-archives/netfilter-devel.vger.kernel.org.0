Here is a design to be able to only allow a set of network protocols and 
deny everything else. This would be complementary to Konstantin's patch 
series which addresses fine-grained access control.

First, I want to remind that Landlock follows an allowed list approach 
with a set of (growing) supported actions (for compatibility reasons), 
which is kind of an allow-list-on-a-deny-list. But with this proposal, 
we want to be able to deny everything, which means: supported, not 
supported, known and unknown protocols.

We could add a new "handled_access_socket" field to the landlock_ruleset 
struct, which could contain a LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE flag.

If this field is set, users could add a new type of rules:
struct landlock_socket_attr {
     __u64 allowed_access;
     int domain; // see socket(2)
     int type; // see socket(2)
}

The allowed_access field would only contain 
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CREATE at first, but it could grow with other 
actions (which cannot be handled with seccomp):
- use: walk through all opened FDs and mark them as allowed or denied
- receive: hook on received FDs
- send: hook on sent FDs

We might also use the same approach for non-socket objects that can be 
identified with some meaningful properties.

What do you think?
