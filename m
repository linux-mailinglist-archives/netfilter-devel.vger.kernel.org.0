In general, we still need to improve the cache logic, to make it finer
grain. Now that we have a single point to populate the cache, things
will get more simple. We need to replace the cache command level to
cache flags or our own cache level definitions. The existing approach
that uses of commands to define the cache level completeness has its
own limitations. We can discuss this during the NFWS :-).
