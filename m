Let's try to stay focused on the audit container ID functionality; I
fear if we start bringing in other unrelated issues we are never going
to land these patches.

I guess complexity is relative in a sense, but reading and writing a
number from a file in procfs seems awfully simple to me.

It's not that simple, there are plenty of container use cases beyond
ps which require procfs:

Most LSM aware applications require procfs to view and manage some LSM
state (e.g. /proc/self/attr).

System containers, containers that run their own init/systemd/etc.,
require a working procfs.

Nested container orchestrators often run in system containers, which
require a working procfs (see above).

I'm sure there are plenty others, but these are the ones that came
immediately to mind.
