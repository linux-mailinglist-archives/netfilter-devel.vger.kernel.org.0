I originally started this infrastructure without the fixup, and there
was a bit of fuzz about it because people complained that TCP
connection somewhat becomes stateless and would get stuck too after
fin packet is seen.

There is also connlimit, which would be distorted after the TCP flow
becomes stateless when handing it over to the flowtable.

Another reason is that hardware offload folks need this, otherwise
hardware entry remains too long in the hardware flowtable.

You mean, just let the fin packet go without tearing down the flow
entry?

Remove it right away then is what you propose?

if dst is stale, packet needs to go back to classic path to get a
fresh route.

That sounds good. But I am afraid some folks will not be happy if TCP
flow becomes stateless again.

Thanks.
