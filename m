This is plain run with no options.

I don't think this needs a kernel fix.

The kernel is free to allocate handle, the guarantee is that they are
unique. How this handles are allocated could change in the future.
There is no way userspace can forecast how handles are allocated.

Phil made some code to skip comparing handles in tests/py that I
remember to deal with this.
