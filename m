Hello Florian, hello all,

More than a year has past since I asked all those questions about
adding expectation attribute to nf_tables, and I finally have time to
work on it. But I find it difficult to understand the way it is
written, and therefore have questions. Here are the first ones (see
below).

Does this mean I should create a new structure containing expectation
data, as required by the nf_ct_expect_init function, and that I should
expect to find this structure at &regs->data[priv->sreg] in
nft_ct_set_eval?
When all this is done, I will have to also update the nftables
command. Will I also need to update the nftables library?

Thank you.
