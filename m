Yes, added.

Should not make a difference due to --check, nothing
is altered.

Because I want it to be simple, it will be enough to drop a ruleset
with the feature into features/ durectory and run-tests.sh would do the
reset.

While its possible to launch nft as a script via

 #!/usr/bin/env nft

This would use the system nft, not the newly built one.  And fudging
with $PATH seems ugly...

I could do that, but I don't see the need for arbitrary scripts so far.

Agree, it should not.

Yes, thats a working alternative but I don't see the need for this.

Can do that.

No, just 30s-stress.  This test is special because its random by nature
and it makes sense to run it for multiple hours once in a while.

Yes, no other script will do this.
I'll send an updated batch soon to see how this looks like with more
feature tests in place.
