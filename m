Might make sense to also do this for days.

nft add inet filter input meta hour '"12:22-12:23"' counter
-> gets parsed as 'meta hour 12:22'.

Could this at least throw an error?  Its not obvious why this doesn't
work as expected.

('"12:22"-"12:23"' will work of course).

nft --debug=netlink add inet filter input meta day '"Sat"-"Fri"' counter

... doesn't do anything.  nft returns 1, but no error is shown.

Looks like range errors are not displayed anymore:
nft --debug=netlink add inet filter input tcp dport 23-22

should throw an error message.
