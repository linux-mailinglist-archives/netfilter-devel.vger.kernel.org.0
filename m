Hello, Günther, Mickaël!

Sorry for the huge delay, I was snowed under with internal project and
academic activity. I've almost finished the v4 patchset and will send it
in a few days.

I expect socket rulesets to be quite small, so theoretically a single
lookup operation should really be almost free.

Anyway, optimization can be implemented by modifying structure
used to contain socket rules (rbtree currently). We can think of
something like "rules" array of AF_MAX * SOCK_MAX (~500) entries,
each entry holding information related to (family, type) pair.

rules[family][type] can be represented by the following stucture:

struct socket_rule {
	bool allowed; // = 0 by default
	struct socket_proto_rule *proto_rules;
};

struct socket_proto_rule {
	struct list_head list;
	int val; // eg. = IPPROTO_TCP
};

It will hold information about each of the following rules:
	1. (family, type, protocol)
	2. (family, type, *)
	3. (family, *,    *)
	4. (family, *,    protocol)

- If user wants to add type 2 rule, we'll just set
	rules[family][type].allowed = 1;

- If user wants to add type 3 rule, we'll perform previous
   operation for every socket type.

- If user wants to add type 1 rule, we'll add a new entry in
   socket_rule.proto_rules linked list.

- For type 4 rule, we'll perform previous operation for every socket
   type.

If we expect to have about 2-3 protocols per-family in worst case, than
lookup overhead should be negligible.

Yes, thank you!

A single thing I'm not quite sure about is that protocols of IP and UNIX
family can be defined in two ways. Socket API allows to have "default"
protocols for each protocol family which can be specified by setting
protocol = 0 in socket(2).

For example, we can define TCP socket as
	socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) and
	socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0).
Theoretically, it can be a little bit uncomfortable to take care about
default values in ruleset definition, but I don't think there is a
pretty way to optimize it.

Ok, thanks for pointing this out!
