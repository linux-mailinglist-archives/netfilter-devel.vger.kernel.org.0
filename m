Yes, i've figured out that NFS can use __sock_create() kernel method for
allocating per-client socket. If kernel allocation of sockets would be
restricted by Landlock that NFS client allocation may fail and proccess
won't be able to connect to the NFS server.

Some of the socket protocols uses kernel space methods like
sock_create_lite() or sock_create_kern() for their own needs.
For example netlink fou family uses sock_create_kern() for UDP
tunneling.

Landlock shouldn't allow to indirectly change the behavior of such
mechanisms from user space.

Yes, accept() should work with any restrictions.

Ok, I'll do it.

Ok, agreed! Mikael can probably give his opinion on this.

Thanks, "unsupported" is indeed an incorrect naming in this case.
To check if the protocol is supported, we'll have to validate 
family-type combination, which would be really ugly.

Taking into account the thoughts below regarding family-type checking,
the following description can be used.

No, I think that checking only ranges is also a good solution. We won't
care about maintaining valid type constants, and that would simplify
behavior of this method for users. Let's take this approach.

Ofc, I'll add appropriate comments in the definition of struct
landlock_socket_attr and in the socket rule documentation. Thanks!
