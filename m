Yes and yes.   Before the current 'for_each_possible_cpu() + seqcount
abuse the abuse was just implicit; xt_replace_table did NOT wait for
readers to go away and relied on arp, eb and ip(6)tables to store the
counters back to userspace after xt_replace_table().

This meant a read_seqcount_begin/retry for each counter & eventually
gave complaits from k8s users that x_tables rule replacement was too
slow.

I'd be ok with going via the simpler solution & wait if k8s users
complain that its too slow.  Those memory blobs can be huge so I would
not use call_rcu here.
