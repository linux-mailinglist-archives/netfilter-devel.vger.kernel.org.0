...so I tried rearranging that struct. The results (on both x86_64 and
aarch64) are rather disappointing: the hole (that we get on 64-bit
architectures) seems to actually be beneficial.

If I turn the 'unsigned long' and 'size_t' members to u32, matching
rates drop very slightly (1-3% depending on the case in the usual
kselftest).

I then tried to shrink it more aggressively ('bb' and 'groups' can be
u8, 'bsize' can probably even be u16), and there the performance hit is
much more apparent (> 10%) -- but this is something I can easily explain
with word masks and shifts.

I'm not sure exactly what happens with the pair of u32's. The assembly
looks clean. I would probably need some micro-benchmarking to
clearly relate this to execution pipeline "features" and to, perhaps,
find a way to shuffle accesses to fields to actually speed this up
while fitting two fields in the same word.

However, I'm not so sure it's worth it at this stage.

I actually bothered with this: even without the trick you explained,
struct field f[0] can safely become f[16] (NFT_REG32_COUNT), and I can
move it to the top, and then push the rcu_head down. This, again, hits
lookup rates quite badly. With f[4] lookup rates are the same as the
current case.

So, well, I wouldn't touch this either -- maybe some micro-benchmarking
might suggest a better way, but I doubt it's worth it right now.
