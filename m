As I said, think of a different use-case:

        ct state new,established

people are _not_ expecting to match on both flags to be set on (that
will actually never happen).

Should ct state and tcp flags use the same syntax (comma-separated
values) but intepret things in a different way? I don't think so.

You can use:

        nft describe ct state

to check for the real datatype behind this selector: it's a bitmask.
For this datatype the implicit operation is not ==.

tcp flags syn / syn makes no sense, it's actually: tcp flags syn.

The goal is to provide a compact syntax for most common operations, so
users do not need to be mingling with explicit binary expressions
(which is considered to be a "more advanced" operation).
