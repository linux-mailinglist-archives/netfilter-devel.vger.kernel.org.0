You could probably update conntrackd to invoke conntrackdctl when you
detect options that represent queries to the daemon. That would allow
you to retain backward compatibility. Hence, old scripts still work
while new ones might start using the new conntrackdctl command.

If the problem is that you would like to skip the config parsing
(which is what has triggered the errors when running things from the
netns environment IIRC), then, you could update the code to skip the
parsing:

- the user does not specify a configuration file

AND

- the options refer to a query to the daemon via UNIX socket.

That's another possibility to consider.
