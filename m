I think this is almost correct, but we need to modify it slightly.
Consider this tree:

      A: 1 (s, a)
       /        \
      /          \
B: 1 (s, i)    C: 3 (e, i)

where, again, 's': starts, 'e': ends, 'a': active, 'i': inactive. Nodes
are additionally named.

We want to insert 2 as a start element, and 'first' in your patch
becomes leaf B, "1 (s, i)" -- not the A node, "1 (s, a)".

Now, depending on the red-black tree insertion implementation (I didn't
bother to check, I guess it should be independent), in the list walk,
A might come before or after B.

If B is before A, fine, we'll meet A and mark it as "rbe_le" (closest
from left).

If A comes before B, we won't meet A, and we won't have a closest
element from the left. This affects the overlapping decision.

The only ambiguity here is represented by elements having the same key,
and a set of such elements is allowed in the tree iff at most one is
active. So we just need to avoid replacing an active "first" by an
inactive node with the same key. Eventually, we'll visit all the nodes
having the same keys, if any:

			if (!first || nft_rbtree_cmp(set, rbe, first) ||
			    nft_set_elem_expired(&first->ext)) ||
			    !nft_set_elem_active(&first->ext, genmask))
				first = &rbe->node;

> +			p = &parent->rb_right;

...and the same here. Maybe we should re-introduce the "expired or
inactive" helper.

The description looks correct to me, but I'm not sure why you add a
break here:

> -		if (d <= 0 && (!rbe_le || nft_rbtree_cmp(set, rbe, rbe_le) > 0))
> +		/* annotate element coming before new element. */

we should stop here iff rbe_ge is already set, right? Otherwise we are
skipping step 3) below.

Everything else looks good to me, thanks a lot, I hope we're finally
sorting this for good :)
