Well, an expression which may set verdict register to NFT_BREAK should
prevent reduction of later expressions in same rule as it may stop rule
evaluation at run-time. This is obvious for nft_cmp, but nft_meta is
also a candidate: NFT_META_IFTYPE causes NFT_BREAK if pkt->skb->dev is
NULL. The optimizer must not assume later expressions are evaluated.

A first step might be said nft_expr_type field indicating a given
expression might stop expression evaluation. Therefore:

| reduce = reduce && expr->ops->type->reduce;

would continue expression reduction if not already stopped and the
current expression doesn't end it.

Taking nft_meta as example again:

* Behaviour changes based on nft_expr_type::select_ops result
* Some keys are guaranteed to not stop expression evaluation:
  NFT_META_LEN for instance will always just fetch skb->len. So
  introduce a callback instead:

| bool nft_expr_ops::may_break(const struct nft_expr *expr);

Then "ask" the expression whether it may change verdict register:

| reduce = reduce && expr->ops->may_break(expr);

With nft_meta_get_ops, we'd have:

| bool nft_meta_get_may_break(const struct nft_expr *expr)
| {
| 	switch (nft_expr_priv(expr)->key) {
| 	case NFT_META_LEN:
| 	case NFT_META_PROTOCOL::
| 	[...]
| 		return false;
| 	case NFT_META_IFTYPE:
| 	[...]
| 		return true;
| 	}
| }

Another thing about your proposed patch: Expressions may update
registers even if not reduced. Could that upset later reduction
decision? E.g.:

| ip saddr 1.0.0.1 ip daddr 2.0.0.2 accept
| ip daddr 3.0.0.3 accept

Code no longer allows the first rule's 'ip daddr' expression to be
reduced (no matter what's in registers already), but it's existence
causes reduction of the second rule's 'ip daddr' expression, right?

Cheers, Phil
