With your patch, this is called for each netlink_recvmsg() invocation,
which is more audit logs.

@@ -3540,9 +3544,6 @@ static int nf_tables_dump_rules(struct sk_buff *skb,
 done:
        rcu_read_unlock();
 
-       if (reset && idx > cb->args[0])
-               audit_log_rule_reset(table, cb->seq, idx - cb->args[0]);
-
        cb->args[0] = idx;
        return skb->len;
 }

netlink dump is composed of a series of recvmsg() from userspace to
fetch the multiple chunks that represent the rules in this table.
If I read fine above, as the netlink dump makes progress, idx will
always go over cb->args[0], which evaluates true for each recvmsg()
call. With my patch this is less audit logs because audit log is only
delivered once for each chain, not for each recvmsg() call.

So patch description is fine as it is :)

Agreed. Audit folks can extend this later on according to their needs
in case they need more fine grain reporting.
