Hey.


Sorry for the delay... but I've been travelling to some science
conference.

What would you think about merely adding a "," after "evaluation"?
"Evaluation ordering" could be understood as implicitly meaning that it
doesn't have an effect on the ordering of the evaluations, but might
still have some other effect (from netfilter's PoV).

I've added a reference to the ADDRESS_FAMILIES chapter.

One may argue now whether this defeats the purpose of the summary
chapter, if one has again to look things up somewhere else.

I have no strong opinion in this case, but I would say that a user
realises quite soon what hooks are (in particular input/output/forward
are probably well known)... so I don't think it's necessary to explain
here *what* they are,... but it's good to give a reference to the full
list, so that a reader can cross check whether some foobar term he
stumbled over is actually a hook or not.

Also disliked that sentence when I wrote it,... but found nothing
better where I could keep it in parentheses.
I removed those now and made two proper sentences.

Also made an analogous change in patch 1 of this series.

I thought it might help to reiterate that drop - unlike accept - is in
fact ultimate, ... in particular to point out, that it can't be
overridden by a later accept in another chain.

Have merely fixed the typo for now, waiting for further feedback,
whether I shall remove it altogether.

Mistakenly used... must have mixed up drop and deny at some point. O:-)

In principle yes, but that's IMO already "quite some" conclusions that
a novice reader would need to draw, i.e. the combination of:
- no drops by any mean
plus
- all chains have a policy
plus
- policy is any of drop/accept
thus, there must be at least one accept, if nothing drops.

In teaching, which this chapter is in principle meant for, I'd rather
keep things as simple as possible not requiring the reader to draw
implicit conclusions.

I changed it however a bit to make it more clear that "at least one
accept" is already implied by "nothing drops".
If you still want it to removed, just tell.

What I wanted to say with that paragraph was effectively:

The ordering of chains via priorities, doesn't matter with respect to
whether a packet is ultimately accepted or dropped.
Except of course, an earlier chain modifies something on the packet,
which no longer causes it to be dropped/accepted.

While that is of course a logical conclusion from the earlier text, I
think it's nevertheless good to have it explicitly mentioned.

E.g. when I transitioned to nftables and looked at what fail2ban does
when using its nftables backend, I was first a bit puzzled when I saw
that it uses a chain priority of -1.
At a first glance I thought +1 would be better so that my normal filter
table could "fast-accept" e.g. all related,established packets and
traversing the (potentially long) fail2ban chain would be short-cut.

Of course I then realised that this is not really how it works, and
short-circuiting is only possibly via drop/reject/etc..

I've reworked the integration of *reject* and verdict-like statements
everywhere.
In some places, like the one here where I describe drop, I still
mention them, though less prominent.
Simply because I think it's helpful if people get told at the important
places, that reject/etc. effectively behave like drop (by internally
issuing it).

Just have a look whether you're fine with the way I did it, and if you
still think it should be changed, we can of course reiterate.

That seems a bit imprecise to me?

The sections describe things from the view of a single packet, but
you're now referring to all traffic?
Also, "must contain/call with"... isn't really exactly true, is it?! I
mean the intention may just be to do that.

"reside" feels also awkward. What about "belong to" or "be from" (which
I'd have chosen now)?

I've completely changed that part, so this is gone anyway.

I think I'm described that now correctly.
Same with respect to your other comments, that were about my wrong
description of how the returning from jump/goto works.

Please check :-)

Well, we've just described in that text, that any later statements will
be ignored.
A user doesn't really know whether or not comment is special and since
it's actually not just a comment with respect to the nftables rules
files, but really stored in the kernel memory - as you say - ... it's
IMO not really obvious whether this happens e.g. in a rule like:
   drop comment "bar"

The mentioning of "comment" (which btw. I've changed now slightly) is
to explain just this - i.e. comment is *not* ignored, even if after the
terminal statement.

I could explain that with an example like:
> drop comment "foo"
>is the same as
> comment "foo" drop

but I thought that's overkill... if no, just tell me.

It's already mentioned, but only in the VERDICTS chapter. So I think it
should be re-iterated in the summary chapter.

This actually might be a valid reason to remove it, but:

- Is this really enforced in all cases (or are there some statements
  where nftables would ignore it but not error out)
- Could that behaviour (of nftables) ever change? Like by adding a
  --only-warn-on-ignored-statements option?
  In that case, we should IMO leave it in.
- What about beyond-the-nftables-utility?
  E.g. if someone uses libnftnl or nftables from python... would it
  still be guaranteed to error out? Cause if that's only a mechanism in
  the utility, we should IMO still describe the true behaviour (of
  ignoring such statements) because users likely use the nft manpage
  for their education.


Thanks,
Chris.

PS: v2 of the patch series will follow in a few minutes.
