No it does not. Please look again. There is only a memcpy if the caller
specifies extra > 0, in which case she clearly intends to mangle it (perhaps
depending on its contents).

"depending on its contents" is where the memcpy deferral comes in. pktb_alloc2()
verifies that the supplied buffer is big enough (size >= len + extra). The user
declared it as a stack variable that size so it will be. With the deferral
enhancement, pktb_alloc2() records the buffer address and extra in the enlarged
struct pktbuff (extra is needed to tell pktb_mangle how much memory to memset to
0).

If pktb_mangle() finds it has to make the packet larger then its original length
and the packet is still in its original location then copy it and zero extra.
(i.e. pktb_mangle() doesn't just check whether it was asked to make the packet
bigger: it might have previously been asked to make it smaller).

Also (and this *is* tricky, update relevant pointers in the struct pktbuff).
That invalidates any poiners the caller may have obtained from e.g. pktb_data()
- see end of email.

Yes it's more complex. No problem with the buffer - the user gave that to
pktb_alloc2().

Problem is that if mangler moves the packet, then any packet pointer the caller
had is invalid (points to the un-mangled copy). This applies at all levels, e.g.
nfq_udp_get_payload(). There is no way for the mangler functions to address
this: it just has to be highlighted in the documentation.

Still, I really like the deferred copy enhancement. Your thoughts?
