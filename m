/me heavily rolls eyes

In my last email to you I said:

"I think it is pointless to record the subject info in this record as we
either have that info from other records in the event or there is no
valid subject info to record."

... I also said:

"As I've mentioned in the thread above, including the auid was done as
a concession to Steve, I don't think it serves any useful purpose."

If phrases like "pointless to record the subject info" and "I don't
think it serves any useful purpose" leave you unsure about what to do,
I'm at a bit of a loss.

Drop the "uid" field.  Drop the "auid" field.  Hopefully those last
two statements should remove any ambiguity from your mind.
