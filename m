I wonder if we could use datatype_set() to attach static datatypes
too, instead of manually attaching datatypes, such as:

        expr->dtype = &integer_type;

in case of future extensions, using consistently this helper function
will help to identify datatype attachments.

That is a correct observation, but a (hipothetical) subtle bug in
refcnt might lead to a dynamic datatype get to refcnt to zero, and
that might be harder to track?

Let me have a look if I can come up with some counter proposal to get
rid of this flag, I would prefer not to infer the datatype class from
reference counter value.
