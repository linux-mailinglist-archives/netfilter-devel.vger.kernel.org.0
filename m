Hi!

I think we do, but they are old to the point of pointlessness. But we
can allocate some testing efforts in February, if you would confirm
the desirability of this information.

I would say "yes," but I'm not sure we mean the same thing.

Jool is currently a box of translating code that interfaces with the
kernel by way of wrappers.

ie. The Netfilter wrapper receives packets by registering itself to
nf_register_hooks(), and the iptables wrapper receives packets by
registering itself to xt_register_targets().

What I mean by integrating Jool into nftables is to create a wrapper
that would receive packets by means of something like
nft_register_expr(). (I'm not entirely sure this is what I'm supposed
to do because I haven't started analyzing this task yet. But that
would be my starting point.)

Does this answer your question?

I'm not averse to the idea of adapting code to fulfill the standards
of the Netfilter project. Jool's core itself has naturally changed
substantially over the years to account for emerging RFCs and feature
requests. It wouldn't be my first major overhaul.

But I admit I don't presently understand how things like the EAM table
([0] [1]) are meant to fit in this model.

(Then again, I don't know much about nftables just yet.)

Thank you! :)
