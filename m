I solved that a bit different now, please have a look whether that's
fine for you.

Hmm. Personally, I think "terminal" is a bit confusing, at least for
beginners, because we have termination on multiple levels:
- Termination of a rule and (AFAICS) then also always of the respective
  base chain and any regular chains called by that.
  As e.g. done by accept.
- Termination of the overall ruleset evaluation.
  As e.g. done by drop, reject (by implying drop).

From how I understood your explanation, the "terminating" is not an
inherent property of e.g. reject itself, but rather of drop/accept,
whereas the inherent property of reject is, that it implies a drop (at
the end).

So I'd have now gone the way to describe reject/synproxy and the NAT
statements as implying a verdict and further explaining that they thus
act like verdicts.
Further, giving, some concrete examples (like that reject also
completely ends ruleset evaluation, as drop does - which I think is
important).

As far as I understood this:
- the NAT statements imply accept (and can later be overruled)
- reject implies drop
- synprxy implies drop
  Not sure what stolen does... since it doesn't seem to appear at
  all=C2=A0in nftables, I merely wrote now, that it implies drop.
  Please correct as needed.
- the others don't even show up in nftables?


Btw, one further question that just popped up:
In the VERDICTS section, accept/drop are described as "absolute", which
at this point I describe in my patch as:
> which immediately terminate the
> evaluation of the current rule, i.e. even any later statements of the
> current
> rule won=E2=80=99t get executed.

a) Does the term "absolute" really just mean "ends the current rule" or
=C2=A0  does it mean additionally mean "and the current base chain and any
   regular ones called from that?
   Cause my current wording, would rather imply it means only the
   former (while the actual verdicts are still described as also
   causing the latter).
b) Are jump/goto/return/queue/etc. i.e. all those which *DON'T* imply a
   accept or drop also absolute? I presume not, if the term also
   means "end current base/regular chains".
   But even if not, do these verdicts (jump/goto/return/queue/etc.)
   still cause the current rule to be ended?
   like in:
      jump counter
   vs
      counter jump

   Even with continue?

Cause then I need to update that in another iteration of the patch
series.

> to unstand rather than describing the mechanism.

I've changed things now as follows:
- In the VERDICTS section, I keep things rather "abstract" and focused
  on the respectve verdict that we're just explaining.
  So examples will be in the evaluation summary chapter rather than
  there.
  Also e.g. at jump/goto it's *not* explained how the return position
  is determined... this is instead done at the return verdict.
  But what I do at jump is, describing what happens if there's an
  absolute verdict and if there's no verdict at all (i.e. the implicit
  return).
  Hope that split up makes kinda sense.

  goto I really describe as exactly jump, just without storing the
  position.
- I also reordered the verdicts to an IMO more reasonable order, in
  particular, continue and queue are IMO the least interesting ones for
  most users.
- In the summary chapter I give examples and describe it a bit more
  human readable.

I did that now in the VERDICTS section and there in the return
statement.
What I do not explicitly mention is that the policy is also applied
when there *is* one last position to pop on the call stack, but when
there's no rule after that (i.e. the jump was the last rule in a base
chain).
But I kinda hope that it's obvious that this then also applies.

In principle that should perhaps be mentioned where policies are
explained (and of course in the summary chapter, too).
Or what would you think?

I've added a number of examples to the summary chapter.
