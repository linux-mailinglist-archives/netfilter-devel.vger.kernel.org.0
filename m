Whats that supposed to convey?

I will take your version (because I tire to iterate this again and again
but I think my version is better.

drop policy and no accept rule -> thats NOT what you want.
And thats what the 'all traffic' in my version intends to say.

Isn't that a rather important point?

I would say most are accepted.

Its not an exception, comment is not a statement.  Its isn't
executed/evaluated.

Its no different than

.... accept # do this

... except that "# do this" won't be sent to kernel and not included
when running 'list ruleset' and so on.
