What if we replace:
iptables-translate  -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "foo bar"
nft add rule ip filter INPUT counter log prefix \"foo bar\"

With
nft add rule ip filter INPUT 'counter log prefix "foo bar"'

IOW, get rid of all escaped_quotes code and change:

-       printf("%s\n", xt_xlate_rule_get(xl));
+
+       if (cs->restore)
+               printf("%s\n", xt_xlate_rule_get(xl));
+       else
+               printf("'%s'\n", xt_xlate_rule_get(xl));


... this would always place everything rule-related printed by xtables-translate in
single quotes while leaving iptables-restore-translate alone.

What do you think?
