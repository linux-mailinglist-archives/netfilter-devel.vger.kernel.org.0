The timer is usually updated from the packet path. We are now planning
to support for refreshing the timer from control plane which is not
supported.

Note it is possible to set custom timeouts in elements too, for
example:

        # nft add element x y { 1.2.3.4 expires 50s }

while default set policy might be different 3m. In this case, you
assume resetting to the default set timeout policy (3m) is fine.

I can keep searching for more scenarios where this timeout refresh
does not make sense in this reset path.
