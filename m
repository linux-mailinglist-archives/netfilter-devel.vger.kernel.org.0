   Sorry, did not get this case. Could please explain it with more details?

   Yep, if some LSM rule (for bind) has been applied a with specific 
port, other attemps to bind with zero/random ports would be refused by 
LSM security checks.

   For ipv4 when connecting to a server a client binds to a random port 
within /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range, by default one my machine
this range is: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
32768   60999.
But for ipv6 there is no such tuning range.

  So with first rule allowing port 0 connect action, the second rule 
with some another port and connect action, as a result test should allow 
that. Correct?
