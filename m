Yes, because it was a cleanup not directly related to the rest.
I've now applied the last patch as well for the same reason.

THe patches look ok to me BUT there is the political issue
that we will now divert, afaict this means that you can now create
iptables-nft rulesets that won't ever work in iptables-legacy.

IMO its ok and preferrable to extending xt_(NF)LOG with a new revision,
but it does set some precedence, so I'm leaning towards just applying
the rest too.

Pablo, Phil, others -- what is your take?
