I can experiment with this next week.

I already have a patch that converts async to sync gc similar to
pipapo but it currently keeps the limited on-demand cycle too.

I would like to avoid this, see below.

Great, I will submit this patch formally with a slightly updated
commit message.

Ugh, yes, no busy bit please.

I'm all in favor of getting rid of rbtree where possible.
So we can keep it in-tree with 'acceptable' shortcomings (= no crashes)
but userspace would no longer use it.
