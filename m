I don't like this.  But its a step in the right direction.

To me run-tests.sh has following issues/pain points:
 - test duration is huge (>10m with debug kernels)
 - all tests run in same netns
 - tries to unloads kernel modules after each test

The need for uid 0 wasn't big on my problem list so far because
I mostly run the tests in a VM.  But I agree its an issue for
auto-build systems / CI and the like.

Are you sure PIDNS unshare is needed for this?

Thats fine, see my recent RFC to add such environment
variables to check if a particular feature is supported or not.

What I don't like here is the NFT_TEST_ROOTLESS environment
variable to alter behaviour of run-tests.sh behavior, but see below.

Why not get rid of the check?  Just auto-switch to unpriv userns and
error out if that fails.  You could just print a warning/notice here and
then try userns mode.  And/or print a notice at the together with the
test summary.

Whats the use case?  If there is a good one, then i'd prefer a command
line switch rather than environment.

I think long term all of the following would be good to have:

1. run each test in its own netns
2. get rid of the forced 'nft flush ruleset' and the rmmod calls
3. Explore parallelisation of tests to reduce total test time
4. Add a SKIP return value, that tells that the test did not run
  (or some other means that allows run-tests.sh to figure out that
   a particular test did not run because its known to not work on
   current configuration).

This would avoid false-positive 'all tests passed' when in reality
some test had to 'exit 0' because of a missing feature or lack of real
root.

Alternatively we could just make these tests fail and leave it to the
user to figure it out, the normal expectation is for all tests to pass,
its mostly when run-tests.sh is run on older kernel releases when it
starts acting up.
