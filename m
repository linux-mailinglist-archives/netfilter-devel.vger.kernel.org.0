Hi Florian, thanks for the fix.

skb_sk_is_prefetched() was introduced in commit cf7fbe660f2d ("bpf:
Add socket assign support"). You may want to split the hunk below into
a dedicated patch for this reason.

I've never heard of someone trying to use socket prefetch /
bpf_sk_assign in conjunction with nf_queue, bit of an unusual case.
Given that `skb_sk_is_prefetched()` relies on the skb->destructor
pointing towards sock_pfree, and this code would change that to
sock_edemux, the difference the patch would make is this: if the
packet is queued and then accepted, the socket prefetch selection
could be ignored. That said, it seems potentially dangerous to fail to
hold the socket reference during the nfqueue operation, so this
proposal is preferable to the alternative. There's possibly ways for
someone to still get such a use case to work even with this patch (eg
via iptables TPROXY target rules), or worse case they could iterate on
this code a little further to ensure this case works (eg by coming up
with a new free func that takes this case into account). More likely,
they would find an alternative solution to their problem that doesn't
involve combining these particular features in the same setup.

I looked closely at this hunk, I didn't look closely at the rest of
the patch. Assuming you split just this hunk into a dedicated patch,
you can add my Ack:
