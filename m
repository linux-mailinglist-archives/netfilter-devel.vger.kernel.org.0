Right, but adding "unregister hooks" to the abort path breaks a
different scenario. This might unregister a hook that, because of a later
wake-up action, needs to stay there, because you cannot call register
a hook from the abort path, it's a bit of a whac-a-mole game.

You are right that this approach incurs in the hook evaluation penalty
from the packet path. But I don't think there's a need to optimize
this feature at this stage. If it turns out that this needs to be
optimized, maybe it should be possible to add a core feature to
disable hook while leaving in registered (ie. hook "dormant" state).

So I'm just inclined to keep it simple while making sure that any
possible (silly) robot-generated sequence with this toggle works fine.
