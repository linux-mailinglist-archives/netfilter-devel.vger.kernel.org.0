Using netlink to filter from kernel space is the optimal solution.

Only one thing: It would be good to test this on older kernels,
because IIRC some of the GET requests during the development, I would
suggest to give it a test with -stable kernels. Probably all of the
needed GET commands are already present there.

In the nftables 1.0.1 release process, I tested it with 4.9.x and
tests where running fine, the error reports were coming from missing
features.

Thanks.
