Thanks, we are already discussing this in a different thread.

Your changeset for jansson look relative small, coding style look also
correct, and you have addressed the memory consumption issue.

It is a pity, I wonder what people do when json in this case? They
have to scavenge in the json soup to find for non-syntactic errors as
we have to do with it?

Having said this, I like jansson implementation, it is neat.

Caching a copy of libjansson in the nftables tree does not look like a
way to go IMO.

Is there a chance to poke them again / refresh your pull request?

Otherwise, we will have to search for alternative path to improve the
existing situation.

Thanks!
