No, sorry, I didn't report that anywhere, I probably should have in
the commit messages for 4/8 and 5/8. This was from v1 at 4/8, single
thread on AMD Epyc 7351, C implementation without unrolled loops:

I would re-run tests on v3 patches and include the comparisons in
commit messages. 

By the way, as you can see, even though the comparison with rbtree is
unfair (comparing > 1 fields adds substantial complexity), without AVX2
it doesn't scale as nicely. I plan to propose some optimisations that
should substantially improve the non-vectorised case, but what I have
in mind right now is a bit convoluted and I would skip it in this
initial submission.
