IIRC, Pablo's demand for not aborting in nft_meta in case of
insufficient data was to insert a value into dreg which will never
match. I think the idea was to avoid accidental matching in situations
where a match doesn't make sense.

For ifindex or ifname I can't come up with a good example, but let's
assume we set dreg to 0 for 'meta l4proto' if pkt->tprot is not
initialized (i.e., pkt->tprot_set is false for whatever reason). A rule
'meta l4proto == 0' would start to match even if l4proto of the packet
is not 0.

Remember, the original problem was that with iptables-legacy, I can do
'! -i foobar' in POSTROUTING chain and it will always match. With
iptables-nft, the same rule will never match.

Maybe we should just go with fixing for iifname/oifname only and leave
the rest as-is?

Cheers, Phil
