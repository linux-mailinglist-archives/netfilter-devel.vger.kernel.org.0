Hello,

I've written a filter to parse out punicode from DNS payloads and rewrite t=
he packet in case it contains any IDN (xn--) marker unless the IDN is on a =
whitelist. Valgrind reports that nfq_create_queue() returns uninitialized
bytes resulting in thiserror:


sudo valgrind --tool=3Dmemcheck --leak-check=3Dyes --show-reachable=3Dyes \
           --num-callers=3D20 --track-fds=3Dyes --track-origins=3Dyes -s \
            ./nfq --syslog --facility LOG_LOCAL0 --log-level info \
                  --port 53  --renice -20 --rewrite-answer

After searching on this list archive, I found 1 question but without a foll=
ow-up answer:
https://marc.info/?l=3Dnetfilter-devel&m=3D137132916826745&w=3D4

Having already spent over a day chasing this. Not having come across other =
cases on github except this person self reporting[1] made me think it must =
be indeed something in my code that I'm missing and that could have trigger=
ed this. Or is it really rare (harmless) bug in libnetfilter?

thanks for any help,
