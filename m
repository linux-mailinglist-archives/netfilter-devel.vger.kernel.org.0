See reply at the bottom of this email regarding ignoring the attached
expression.

I think this qualifies as a fix, it will be a two-liner, we could
send it to -stable?

I was thinking about the counter per set element case, this is
something we don't support and IIRC ipset does. After this fix, we can
probably make a patch to check if the NFT_SET_EXT_EXPR exists, so we
can add counter per element matching a lookup. We also need a way to
say that this set has an expression counter when definiting the set.
At some point we might need to support for stateful objects per set
element too so users can also dump-and-reset an specific element
counter.
