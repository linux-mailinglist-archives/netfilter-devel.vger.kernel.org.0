Hi Florian,

Hmyeah, I know.  I am really trying with stateless NAT, which I know is not the general advise.  Intending to push p2p applications, I fear that things like a TCP SYN from two ends at the same time are asking for trouble.

Yes, that's what I meant with this.

Yes, I made a mistake.  It should have said "icmp ip daddr set".

On a side note, I found a good reason for "th daddr" instead of "@th,16,16" that goes beyond readability: its typing can be used in a map with inet_service, unlike @th,16,16 which is a variably-sized integer.

Thanks for warning me upfront.  I will try to stay away from it then until I really have the time.

Best,
