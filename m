Thanks for explaining.

This update is large it comes with its own risks and I see chances
that existing applications might break with this "transparent"
approach (where user is not aware that libnfnetlink is not used
anymore).

So far main complains with the new API is that it is too low level
(some users do not want to know about netlink details). The old API is
popular because it provides an easy way for users to receive packets
from the nfnetlink subsystem without dealing with netlink details.

My suggestion is to extend the new API with more functions to make it
ressemble more like the old API. Then, document how to migrate from
the old API to the new API, such documentation would be good to
include a list of items with things that have changed between old and
new APIs.

Would you consider feasible to follow up in this direction? If so,
probably you can make new API proposal that can be discussed.

I hope this does not feel discouraging to you, I think all this work
that you have done will be useful in this new approach and likely you
can recover ideas from this patchset.

Thanks for your patience.
