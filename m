Wait, you need data & len to describe where the data is *now*. You need an extra
buf, buflen pair for where to put it.

I think I can do as you requested.

Just one thing: do you really think pktb_alloc2 is a good name when users *must
not* call pktb_free? pktb_put would have been good but it's already taken.

Perhaps pktb_alloc2 could set a flag for pktb_free to become a no-op and maybe
issue a warning the first time it is called - would that be worth doing?

In pktb_alloc2, if extra == 0 then buf can be NULL and buflen 0, since the data
will be left in place. That way, we get a single entry point doing as much
optimising as possible.

Cheers ... Duncan.
