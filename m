Yes, this should not be an issue, but something to keep in mind.

I agree that we should be able to control listen according to the binded
port, see https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/15
In a nutshell, the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_LISTEN_TCP should make more sense
for most use cases, but I think LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP is also
useful to limit opened (well-known) ports and port spoofing.

An alternative could be to only use LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP for
explicit binding (i.e. current state, but with appropriate
documentation), and delegate to LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_LISTEN_TCP the
control of binding with listen(2).  That should free us from
implementing check_tcp_socket_can_listen().  The rationale would be that
a malicious sandboxed process could not explicitly bind to a
well-specified port, but only to a range of dedicated random ports (the
same range use for auto-binding with connect).  That could also help
developers by staying close to the kernel syscall ABI (principle of
least astonishment).

That would be good indeed.  Netfilter or network folks? Eric?
