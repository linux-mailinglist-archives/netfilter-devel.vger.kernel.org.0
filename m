Yep, this was broken.  It did never occur to me to use this
for anything other than 'stop accepting new connections from
address/network when over x'.

Its currently ending gc early after 8 reaped entries.

Yes.

There is this:
        if ((u32)jiffies == READ_ONCE(list->last_gc))
                return false;

i.e. we never collect more than once per jiffy and list.

(actually we could, if one cpu has sailed past the test
 and another cpu completed the list walk right after,
 but I don't think its a frequent thing to happen).

I don't think its worth playing with further logic here
because even if entry x was checked one jiffy ago there
is always a chance that this connection has been torn
down right now.

If you think its needed to avoid long list walks
(i.e. resume on next packet), then I think we need
a dedicated gc function that does this, e.g. by
relinking scanned-and-valid entries at the tail.

But for insert case we have to scan until we reach
end-of-list or evict at least one entry, else we report
incorrect ct count.
