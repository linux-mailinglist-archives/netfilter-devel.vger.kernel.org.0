it broke golang library for nftables:
https://github.com/google/nftables/issues/329

Fix is:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netfilter/nf-next.git/commit/?id=09efbac953f6f076a07735f9ba885148d4796235

Current discussion centers more on what bf2ac490d28c wants,
what it does, what netlink can provide in practice and what
userspace would expect/need.

Its not about the types, its more about available buffer space for acks.

It happens in practice, e.g.:
https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter/aKrK6h2zYdqj2unR@lilyboudoir.localdomain/

(every set element triggers another error message).
Note, this is without NLM_F_ACK, just due to error messages
triggered during batch processing.

I think we can all agree on that :-)

Thanks for clarifying.

This should work, IFF the batch is small enough so receive buffer can
hold all acks.

nftables doesn't bail out on first error (transaction will fail and
no permanent changes are made, but it will move to next contained
message.
