Right, this will not work.

i.e. sizeof(unsigned long) == 16 on this architecture?

We cannot change any of these structures unless the layout doesn't
change on 32bit and 64 bit arches.

No idea, I don't know this architecture.
In iptables, userspace and kernel space exchange binary blobs via
get/setsockopt calls, these binary blobs consists of the relevant
ipt/ip6t/xt_entry structures, matches, targets etc.

Their layout must be the same in userspace and kernel.

If they are not, you lose and only "solution" is more crap added to
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES_COMPAT.
(The reason for this being a Kconfig option is because I want to remove it).

I doubt -—with-kernel is tested at all.

Not tested, looks like it no longer works.

No idea, possible.

Yes, but this is unwanted.

No, its just that noone has done a full resync in a long time.
The kernel headers are authoritative, but I fear that just replacing
them with recent upstream versions will result in more surprises just
like the ones you found, which need to be fixed up on userspace side.

Why are you interested in getting iptables to work?

It would be better to ensure that nftables is working properly; unlike
with xtables the kernel representation is hidden from userspace.
