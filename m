I remember now what the intention was.

This include is fine as is: new applications should cache a copy of
nfnetlink_queue.h in their own tree, that's the recommended way to go.
This is the approach that we follow in other existing userspace
netfilter codebase (ie. the userspace program caches the kernel UAPI
header in the tree). The linux_nfnetlink_queue.h header is a legacy
file only for backward compatibility, it should not be used for new
software. This is not documented, the use of this include in
examples/nf-queue.c was intentional.

This approach also allows to fall back to the UAPI kernel headers that
are installed in your system.

Thanks.
