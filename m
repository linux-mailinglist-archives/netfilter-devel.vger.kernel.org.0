This update is obsoleting several comments in the code, such as:

        /* IPS_NAT_CLASH removes the entry automatically on the first
         * reply.  Also prevents UDP tracker from moving the entry to
         * ASSURED state, i.e. the entry can always be evicted under
         * pressure.
         */
        loser_ct->status |= IPS_FIXED_TIMEOUT | IPS_NAT_CLASH;

According to 6a757c07e51f ("netfilter: conntrack: allow insertion of
clashing entries"), the idea is to let this packet go through (no
drop!) while next packets will already find the conntrack entry that
won race.

You mentioned this fix is for IPVS, you said:

Hm. But this IPS_NAT_CLASH entry should not be ever found by other
packets, this is just a dummy entry for _this_ packet that has a
clashing entry, to let it go through.

Something is missing here, I still don't see how all this make sense.
