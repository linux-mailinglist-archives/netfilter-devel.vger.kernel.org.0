Yes, because it seems you assume hostnames are stored in the iptables 
rules when it's not. When the rule is entered, hostnames are resolved 
*once* to IP addresses, and the rules with the IP addresses are 
transferred to the kernel and used there. Simple example:

# iptables -A FORWARD -d smtp.google.com -j ACCEPT

Does it mean it's a single rule in the kernel with the hostname 
smtp.google.com? No, not at all:

# iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             eg-in-f26.1e100.net 
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             ef-in-f26.1e100.net 
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             ed-in-f27.1e100.net 
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             ef-in-f27.1e100.net 
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             eg-in-f27.1e100.net 

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination    

At the time when the command was entered smtp.google.com could be resolved 
into five IPv4 addresses and that resulted not a single rule with a 
hostname, but five rules with IP addresses. The "iptables -L" simply 
translates back the IP addresses to the corresponding names in the DNS.

If the name resolution of smtp.google.com *changes* after the rule was 
entered, it has no effect whatsoever.

Hostnames in iptables/nftables rules should be avoided, especially for 
dynamically changed hostnames.

Best regards,
Jozsef
