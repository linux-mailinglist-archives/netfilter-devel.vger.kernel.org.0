Hi,

This is another iteration of the set element automerge codebase rework,
posted last time in March 1st.

This series comes with a oneliner fix for Patch 2/7 "src: replace interval
segment tree overlap and automerge" that sets on i->elem_flags instead of
elem->elem_flags (this was breaking open intervals).

Now tests/monitor are passing fine in this batch.

This patchset removes the segment tree interval overlap/automerge codebase.
This is replaced with mergesort of the set elements + check for overlaps by
linearly iterating the set elements. This also allows to use automerge with
set element deletions.

This is passing tests/shell, tests/py and tests/monitor.

Pablo Neira Ayuso (7):
  src: add EXPR_F_KERNEL to identify expression in the kernel
  src: replace interval segment tree overlap and automerge
  src: remove rbtree datastructure
  mnl: update mnl_nft_setelem_del() to allow for more reuse
  intervals: add support to automerge with kernel elements
  evaluate: allow for zero length ranges
  intervals: support to partial deletion with automerge
