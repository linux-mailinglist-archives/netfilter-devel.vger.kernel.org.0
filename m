Yes, I wrote a small benchmark based on some Kubernetes use-case. It
measures loading of dumps like:

| *nat
| :KUBE-SVC-23 - [0:0]
| :KUBE-SEP-23 - [0:0]
| -A KUBE-HOOK ! -s 10.128.0.0/14 -d 172.30.108.136/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment \"openshift-controller-manager/controller-manager:https cluster IP\" -m tcp --dport 443 -j KUBE-MARK-MASQ
| -A KUBE-HOOK -d 172.30.108.136/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment \"openshift-controller-manager/controller-manager:https cluster IP\" -m tcp --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-23
| -A KUBE-SVC-23 -j KUBE-SEP-23
| -A KUBE-SEP-23 -s 10.128.0.38/32 -j KUBE-MARK-MASQ
| -A KUBE-SEP-23 -p tcp -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 10.128.0.38:8443
| COMMIT

Into a ruleset with increasing size (created by repeating the snippet above):

size (*100) |	legacy     |   nft-pre	   |   nft-post
