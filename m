Ok, so this is 'just' a bug in the ebtables translation layer.

Its likely that there are alignment differences on aarch that the
ebtables i686 fixups are not aware of.

I meant I wasn't sure if the ebtables compat stuff is compiled in on
non-amd64 platforms.  But I guess they are because iptables works for
you.

The proper solution is to make the existing translation work on aarch64.

It will take me some time to get a crosscompiler+qemu setup going
though.
