You can start this commit message with the same description as in the
cover letter.

OK, you can extend the comment with this information, but no need for
the links.

Looks good.

If you're sure this cannot be triggered from user space, you can wrap
the test with WARN_ON_ONCE(), but we need to be careful.  I'd like to
get the point of view of kernel network expert though.

Eric, is this assumption correct?

This looks good, but we need to explain this rationale in comments, with
explicit mention of network stack functions.

Testing with espintcp makes sense for this clone case.  I hope it would
not require too much boilerplate code though.  We can and should add all
the required kernel option in tools/testing/selftests/landlock/config,
and we should not restrict tests to default kernel options, quite the
contrary if it makes sense.

Indeed, it is worth mentioning in a comment.
