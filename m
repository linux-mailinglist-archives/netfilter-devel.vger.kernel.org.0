I mean: If you can achieve this via standard features available in
doxygen to keep this maintainable along time, such as \manonly or
such, then that's good.

Otherwise, extending doxygen should be the way to keep it simple.
I understand doxygen might generate a little but "distintive" output,
that's OK. I'd rather not to add more dependencies on this.

Thanks.
