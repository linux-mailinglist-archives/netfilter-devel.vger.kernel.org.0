Hmm. There might be exceptions, but typically we should have a function
that takes an optional chain name and the body roughly looks like this:

| if (chain) {
| 	return do_something(nft_chain_find(..., chain));
| }
| return nft_chain_foreach(..., do_something);

Which in particular are those?

The overall agenda is that looking up a chain won't be a trivial
nftnl_chain_list lookup anymore. And iterating over a table's chains
won't be a matter of iterating over a list, because I split base-chains
from user-defined ones:

* Base-chains sit in an array of size NF_INET_NUMHOOKS.
* User-defined chains sit in an (open-coded) list ordered by name.

So the old nft_chain_list_get() is not possible anymore, therefore I
replace everything by either nft_chain_find() or nft_chain_foreach().
Functions should not use both in the same code-path, so if you spot that
I should have a close look again.

Cheers, Phil
