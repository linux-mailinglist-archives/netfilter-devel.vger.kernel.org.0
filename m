Interesting concept, thanks for exploring this.

This might be useful for other representation transformations, cf. the
pending 'remove register zeroing' patchset.

If that breaks 3rd party users we can now simply force the zeroing
from the internal ruleset representation.

I think its good to re-evaluate the eval loop from time to time
and axe whats not needed anymore.

I like this approach.

Oh, I was about to ask if you're using an out-of-tree version but
then I saw you picked this to test *absence* of any cmp/bitwise.

Did not expect such a big difference.

Excellent, thanks!  I think this is a good appraoch, I will review
patches in more detail soon.
