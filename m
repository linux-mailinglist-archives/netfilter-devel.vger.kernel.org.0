Thanks, that makes it much clearer.

I agree that abort and/or commit phases cannot register hooks.

... but that is doable in the sense that unregister can't fail.

Ok, too bad.

No concern, I did not understand the problem with hook register in
abort/commit.

I also dislike that dormat tables now retrain the hook overhead, but
I guess dormat tables are an exception and not the norm, so maybe
unfounded concern.
