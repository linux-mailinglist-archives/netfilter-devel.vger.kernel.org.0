I like this in particular because it would save CPU.. as long as the 
condition is not met AFAIU we don't need to check if the list is updated 
or not.

This would be easy to add to the proposed patch.

I guess we care only about long lists.. maybe as Florian said stopping 
after 8 collects is enough. We could reduce it if needed.

My proposal is to defer all the changes to nf_conncount.c to a follow-up 
patch on nf-next. As there are more users of this, it seems risky to me 
to change the logic on rc4 or greater. What if I send a v3 with the 
change mentioned above to save some CPU cycles and then we move forward 
the discussion in a series for nf-next? Do you agree?

Thanks,
Fernando.
