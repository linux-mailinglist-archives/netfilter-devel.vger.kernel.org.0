Yes, this seems reasonable. Right now old kernels would search for the
prefix as full interface name which is sane but may lead to unexpected
results: E.g. on a system with eth1, eth10 and eth11, the kernel would
find a device matching "eth1*" and users had to check 'list hooks' to
see what really happened.

Looks like I opened a new can by mentioning interfaces named "eth*", as
my proposed user space implementation doesn't support them it seems.

Changing my code to use a new attribute NFTA_DEVICE_WILDCARD should be
easy, but I'll look into proper evaluate integration.

Thanks, Phil
