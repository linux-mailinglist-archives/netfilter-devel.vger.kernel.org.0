Yes, and more importantly they can miss the MTCP semantic and then not
properly filter such packet, which can be use to escape the network
policy.  See some issues here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_TCP

The point is that we cannot assume anything about other networking
stacks, and if Landlock can properly differentiate between TCP and MTCP
(e.g. with new LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_MTCP) users of such firewalls
could still limit the impact of their firewall's bugs.  However, if
Landlock treats TCP and MTCP the same way, we'll not be able to only
deny MTCP.  In most use cases, the network policy should treat both TCP
and MTCP the same way though, but we should let users decide according
to their context.

From an implementation point of view, adding MTCP support should be
simple, mainly tests will grow.

According to the description, patch 2 may be included in this series if
it can be tested with any other LSM, but I cannot read these patches:
