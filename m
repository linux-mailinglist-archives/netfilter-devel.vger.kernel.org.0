I got a similar report from another user, which also mentioned about
IPv6, I did not manage to reproduce this issue yet.

If this is a generic issue in the flowtable with IPv6, probably try to
reproduce this issue in an easier to debug environment, such as qemu
VM with a kernel running CONFIG_KASAN might help.
