Subject: [RFC] netfilter: ipset: fix AHASH_MAX_SIZE to documented one
Date:   Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:59:50 +0200

Ran into getting a different default value applied for `bucketsize` as
documented in the man page, i.e., 12 vs. 14, for example:

`create foo hash:net family inet hashsize 64 maxelem 64`

ipset save tells me:
`create foo hash:net family inet hashsize 64 maxelem 64 bucketsize 12 initval 0xd4f64074`

But the man page states:
> Possible values are any even number between 2-14 and the default is 14.

In the kernel code the `AHASH_MAX_SIZE`, which was used to bound
check any value coming from user space and acts also as default, was
defined to `2 * 6` = 12, it almost seems like it was inteded to
define the span of valid values (2 - 14 = 12 after all) but then used
as actual upper bound everywhere, so it was lost that the range
starts on 2, not zero.

Either one should be fixed and I went for the code, seems nicer to
have a bigger tuning range, the docs are quite explicit and the
commit ccf0a4b7fc68 ("netfilter: ipset: Add bucketsize parameter to
all hash types")' that introduced the change on the kernelside
doesn't mentions any range/default values at all.

So I just added the AHASH_INIT_SIZE and checked all use sites of
`AHASH_MAX_SIZE`, but those sites basically are only the range checks
anyway.

sending as RFC as one could still go for the docs fix instead and
because I'm not to versed with the whole netfilter code base, so may
overlook something.
