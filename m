Indeed, thats would be better.

Thanks, I'll use it.

Thanks a lot, will be fixed!

Agreed

There are checks for family and type ranges in __sock_create. Protocol
ranges should be checked in methods specific to protocol family after
LSM hook is triggered. But it would be safer to keep this check in order
to be independent of the specific kernel version.

It seems clearer and simpler to me, so I think we should use your
approach. Probably, pack_socket_key() should be changed to pack values
using bit operations instead of socket_key structure:
	key = protocol << 16 | type << 8 | family;
