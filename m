In my code, I add/delete firewall rules multiple times from one main process (without killing the main process in between) by calling xtables_init_all, xtables_register_target and xtables_register_match every time. When a rule is added, I call xtables_fini to clean up.

It tries loading the DSO which calls xtables_register_*. After adding the rule, you should free the rule, not deinit the library.

If the match/target is never registered up front, the list of pending matches/targets will be empty and xtables_find_* will fail. This is also done in the iptables flow, e.g. in extensions/libxt_tcp.c.

The functions search for the extension in xtables_pending_* list, but if
not found they will call load_extension() unless NO_SHARED_LIBS is
defined. In the latter case, extension code is built-in and extensions'
_init() functions are called from init_extensions*() functions which in
turn are called by iptables at program start.

> I do free the rule after adding it, and it felt reasonable to deinit the library as well, as this is also done for iptables.

The various iptables binaries deinit the library at program exit and
don't reuse it. 

I don't know what you used as blueprint for your implementation, but you
might want to have a look at iptables_restore_main() in
iptables/iptables-restore.c. It basically does:

| xtables_init()
| xtables_set_nfproto()
| 
| init_extensions()
| 
| /* do all the work, repeatedly, unlimited if reading from stdin */
| 
| xtables_fini()
| exit()

Cheers, Phil
