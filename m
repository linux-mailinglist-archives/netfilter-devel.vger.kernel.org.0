Not only out-of-window packets. Any invalid initial packet being sent
that triggers a transition to invalid state will be dropped, eg.
spoofed TCP traffic, right?

My concern is that, if conntrack drops invalid traffic by default,
user gets no reports that this is going on other than enabling
conntrack logging, because the rule that matches and drop INVALID
packets does match anymore.
