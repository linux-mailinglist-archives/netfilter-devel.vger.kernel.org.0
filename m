Phil could dig it out from git history :-):

I don't think such a change in the behaviour could properly be 
communicated to the users, let alone notified them about such a change. It 
could cause such subtle errors out there, which are hard to identify and 
fix: they'll debug the rules/user chains and the very last the base rule 
policy.

I know lots of effort went into backward compatibility, this should be 
included there too.

Best regards,
Jozsef
