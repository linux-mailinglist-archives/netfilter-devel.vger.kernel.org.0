INPUT is late if you know what ports you want to allow, use
netdev/ingress instead.

This should be easy to handle with a dynamic set, which allows for
packet path to add elements to set.

You should look at nftables concatenations, you do not have to split
this information accross two sets in nftables. For adding entries from
packet path, have a look at dynamic sets.

Two sets also means two lookups from packet path.

You pick your poison. I keep listening to this argument, I think
things got a lot better. There is still room to improve documentation,
that I can take. I don't think it makes sense to start a firewall with
iptables/ipset in 2023.
