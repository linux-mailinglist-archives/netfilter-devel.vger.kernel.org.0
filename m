No, its not my use case.

The use case is to make sure that the frankenkernels that I am in charge
of do not miss any important bug fixes.

This is the reason for the feature probing, "skip" should tell me that
I can safely ignore it because the feature is not present.

I could built a list of "expected failures", but that will mask real
actual regressions.

I did keep the test back until I saw that -stable had picked it up.

I can wait longer, sure.

Its also a bug that needs to be fixed in the kernel.
I applied it after stable had picked it up for 6.5.7.

I don't think that kernel versions work or are something that we can
realistically handle.  Even just RHEL would be a nightmare if one
considers all the different release streams.

I think even just handling upstream -stable is too much work.

That said, I hope that these kinds of tests will happen less frequently
over time.
