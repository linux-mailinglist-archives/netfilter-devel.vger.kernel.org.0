Actually, the flags, extensions (nomatch, timeout, skbinfo, etc.) in ipset 
are some kind of mappings and do matter which entry is matched and which 
flags, extensions are applied to the matching packets.

Therefore the matching in the net kind of sets follow a strict ordering: 
most specific match wins and in the case of multiple dimensions (like 
net,net above) it goes from left to right to find the best most specific 
match.

I think sets should not store information about which order the entries 
were added. That should totally be indifferent. The input of the sets may 
come from countless sources and if the order of adding the entries matters 
then a preordering is required, which is sometimes non-trivial.

This makes also impossible to make exceptions in the sets in nftables - 
with the "nomatch" flag in ipset one can easily create exceptions in 
intentionally overlapping entries (in whatever deep nestings) in a single 
set. In practice it comes quite handy to say

ipset create access_to_servers hash:ip,port,net
ipset add access_to_servers your_ssh_server,22,x.y.z.0/24
ipset add access_to_servers your_ssh_server,22,x.y.z.32/27 nomatch
...

and exclude access to some parts of a given subnet.

However, the internals of the sets in nftables are totally different from 
ipset, so I'm pretty sure it's absolutely not trivial (and sometimes 
impossible) to provide exactly the same behaviour.
