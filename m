Not as far as I can tell: Objects are sorted by name, rule ordering is
inherently relevant.

The reason why JSON_PRESERVE_ORDER exists is just because ordering does
not matter per se. For a proper JSON parser,
| {"a": 1, "b": 2}
and
| {"b": 2, "a": 1}
are semantically identical.

Why? If we change e.g. the ordering of array elements by adding them in
reverse, isn't this a legal change and any testsuite complaints about it
just noise?

Then why not store JSON dumps pretty printed to make diffs more
readable?

Is this "can" in a pending patch? Because I don't see that "prettified
diff" option in tests/shell/helpers/test-wrapper.sh.
