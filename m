It is true that chances that this code runs multiple times since the
new fine-grain caching logic is in place.

Would this patch still work after this series are applied:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/list/?series=151404

That is working and passing tests. It is just missing the code to
restore the fine grain dumping, that should be easy to add.

That logic will really reduce the chances to exercise all this cache
dump / cache cancel. Bugs in this cache consistency code is usually
not that easy to trigger and usually hard to fix.

I just think it would be a pity if that work ends up in the trash can.
