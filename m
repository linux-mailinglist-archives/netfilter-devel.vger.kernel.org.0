It was merely loud thinking - combining repeated 'add element' commands
is fine with me for avoiding the problem. I have an alternative in mind
where added elements are appended to the set without EXPR_F_KERNEL and
removed ones also with EXPR_F_REMOVE. So after nft_evaluate() one could
do all the overlap detection / auto merging / element removing once for
each changed set.
