Hi Timo,

Practically speaking I think it's a bug, but I can't find a formal,
complete definition of automerge, so one can also say it "adds items up
to and including the first conflicting one", and there you go, it's
working as intended.

In general, when we discussed this "automerge" feature for
multi-dimensional sets in nftables (not your case, but I aimed at
consistency), I thought it was a mistake to introduce it altogether,
because it's hard to define it and whatever definition one comes up
with might not match what some users think. Consider this example:

# ipset create s hash:net,net
# ipset add s 10.0.1.1/30,192.168.1.1/24
# ipset add s 10.0.0.1/24,172.16.0.1
# ipset list s
[...]
Members:
10.0.1.0/30,192.168.1.0/24
10.0.0.0/24,172.16.0.1

good, ipset has no notion of automerge, so it won't try to do anything
bad here: the set of address pairs denoted by <10.0.1.1/30,
192.168.1.1/24> is disjoint from the set of address pairs denoted by
<10.0.0.1/24, 172.16.0.1>. Then:

# ipset add s 10.0.0.1/16,192.168.0.0/16
# ipset list s
[...]
Members:
10.0.1.0/30,192.168.1.0/24
10.0.0.0/16,192.168.0.0/16
10.0.0.0/24,172.16.0.1

and, as expected with ipset, we have entirely overlapping entries added
to the set. Is that a problem? Not really, ipset doesn't support maps,
so it doesn't matter which entry is actually matched.

# nft add table t
# nft add set t s '{ type ipv4_addr . ipv4_addr; flags interval ; }'
# nft add element t s '{ 10.0.1.1/30 . 192.168.1.1/24 }'
# nft add element t s '{ 10.0.0.1/24 . 172.16.0.1 }'
# nft add element t s '{ 10.0.0.1/16 . 192.168.0.0/16 }'
# nft list ruleset
table ip t {
	set s {
		type ipv4_addr . ipv4_addr
		flags interval
		elements = { 10.0.1.0/30 . 192.168.1.0/24,
			     10.0.0.0/24 . 172.16.0.1,
			     10.0.0.0/16 . 192.168.0.0/16 }
	}
}

also fine: the least generic entry is added first, so it matches first.
Let's try to reorder the insertions:

# nft add element t s '{ 10.0.0.1/16 . 192.168.0.0/16 }'
# nft add element t s '{ 10.0.0.1/24 . 172.16.0.1 }'
# nft add element t s '{ 10.0.1.1/30 . 192.168.1.1/24 }'
Error: Could not process rule: File exists
add element t s { 10.0.1.1/30 . 192.168.1.1/24 }
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

...because that entry would never match anything: it's inserted after a
more generic one that already covers it completely, and we'd like to
tell the user that it doesn't make sense.

Now, this is pretty much the only advantage of not allowing overlaps:
telling the user that some insertion doesn't make sense, and thus it
was probably not what the user wanted to do.

So... I wouldn't know how deal with your use case, even in theory, in a
consistent way. Should we rather introduce a flag that allows any type
of overlapping (default with ipset), which is a way for the user to
tell us they don't actually care about entries not having any effect?

And, in that case, would you expect the entry to be listed in the
resulting set, in case of full overlap (where one set is a subset, not
necessarily proper, of the other one)?

I don't think so either, still I kind of expect to see the issues you
report as these features seem to start being heavily used just recently.

And I (maybe optimistically) think that all we need to iron out the
most apparent issues on the subject is a few reports like yours, so
thanks for sharing it.
