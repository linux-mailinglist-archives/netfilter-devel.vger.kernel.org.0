The crucial aspect of this implementation is to provide a compatible
rule representation for old software which is not aware of it. This is
only possible by dumping the compat representation in the well-known
NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS attribute.

This means what is contained in NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS may not be what
the kernel actually executes. To make this less scary, the kernel should
dump the actual rule in a second attribute for the sake of verification
in user space.

While rule dumps are pretty much fixed given the above, there is
flexibility when it comes to loading the rule:

A) Submit the compat representation as additional attribute

This was my initial approach, but Florian objected because the changing
content of NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS attribute may be confusing:

On input, NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS contains the new rule representation, on
output it contains the compat one. The extra attribute I introduced
behaves identical, i.e. on input it holds the compat representation
while on output it holds the new one.

B) Submit the new representation as additional attribute

This is the current approach: If the additional attribute is present,
the kernel will use it to build the rule and leave NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS
alone (actually: store it for dumps). Otherwise it will "fall back" to
using NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS just as usual.

When dumping, if a stored NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS content is present, it
will dump that as-is and serialize the active rule into an additional
attribute. Otherwise the active rule will go into NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS
just as usual.

See above. I hope it clarifies things.

I am swapping things around in libnftnl - it uses NFTA_RULE_ACTUAL_EXPRS
if present and puts NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS into a second list for
verification only. In iptables, I parse both lists separately into
iptables_command_state objects and compare them. If not identical,
there's a bug.

No problem.
