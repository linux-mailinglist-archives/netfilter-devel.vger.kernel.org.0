I had another idea, namely teaching flex to recognize a bit of context
by defining e.g. 'table <something>' as a keyword. But this turns into a
mess when it comes to optional family specifiers, line breaks, etc. Also
this is probably not how lex/yacc was meant to be used.

The reason why I keep getting back to this is the increasing impact on
users over time: Whenever we introduce a new keyword, we potentially
break someone's working ruleset.

With bison not even accepting quoted names everywhere, there is no way
out even for cautious users.

Can we please restart discussions on how to solve this issue?

Cheers, Phil
