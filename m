For some tests, the dump is not stable or useful to test. For example,
if they have an "expires" timestamps. Those tests don't have a .nft file
in the dumps directory, and don't have it checked.

DUMPGEN=y generates a new dump file, if the "dumps/" directory exists.
Omitting that directory is a way to prevent the generation of the file.
However, many such tests share their directory with tests that do have dumps.

When running tests with DUMPGEN=y, new files for old tests are generated.
Those files are not meant to be compared or committed to git because
it's known to not work.

Whether a test has a dump file, is part of the test. The absence of the
dump file should also be recorded and committed to git.

Add a way to opt-out from such generating such dumps by having .nodump
files instead of the .nft dump.

Later we should add unit tests that checks that no test has both a .nft
and a .nodump file in git, that the .nodump file is always empty, and
that every .nft/.nodump file has a corresponding test committed to git.
