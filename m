For the simplest case

eth.100 base on eth


eth.100  and ethx are route interface.

Without this patch.

The packet outgoing path from eth   --- >  ethx

The packet incoming path from ethx ---->  eth.100---> eth

 With this patch

The packet incoming path from ethx   (direct to)---> eth, it is the same with outgoing.
