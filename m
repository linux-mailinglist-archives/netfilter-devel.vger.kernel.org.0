Its an extra kernel option that needs to be enabled for this to work.
Probably on for all distro kernels by now but whats the added benefit?

I disagree, I think a notice is fine, this disclaimer could be
repeated after test summary.

Especially if we start skipping tests we should also have
an indication that not all tests were run (ideally, we'd see which
ones and how many...).

If you absolutely insist then fine.

I meant $(id) -eq 0 || barf

I think the best is to:
./run-tests.sh called with uid 0   -> no changes
./run-tests.sh called with uid > 0 -> try unpriv netns and set
NFT_TEST_HAVE_USERNS=1 in the environment to allow test cases to adjust
if needed (e.g. bail out early).

Ah.  Well, with my proposal above you can still set
NFT_TEST_HAVE_USERNS=1 manually before ./run-tests.sh if uid 0 isn't
really uid 0.

Yuck.  Do we need a totally different script then?

./run-tests.sh is for humans, not machines. I want sane defaults.

Then add a warning?  I very much dislike these environment variables,
developers will add them to their bash init scripts and then there is
big surprise why someone reports unexpected results/behaviours.

Command line options are typically known, environment not.
Don't get me wrong, environment variables are good, I have no objections
to setting NFT_TEST_HAVE_USERNS or the like for the individual tests to
consume.

Can't we have a sane default without a need for new command line options
or enviroment variables?

Thats a good thing.  I do not care if I have to call ./run-tests.sh
or 'make tests', but please, sane defaults without code path explosion.
