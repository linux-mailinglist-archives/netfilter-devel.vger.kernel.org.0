I found this is clearer to me (mention of bind/connect port).

In networking, "5-tuple" is a well-known term for connection, which is
src/dest ip, src/dest port, protocol. That is why I asked about
src/dest port.  It seems that we only support src/dest port at this
moment, right ?

Another feature we could consider is restricting a process to "no
network access, allow out-going , allow incoming", this might overlap
with seccomp, but I think it is convenient to have it in Landlock.

Adding protocol restriction is a low hanging fruit also, for example,
a process might be restricted to UDP only (for RTP packet), and
another process for TCP (for signaling) , etc.

Thanks!
