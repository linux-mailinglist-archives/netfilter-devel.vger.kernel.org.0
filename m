In nftables, this is realized via 'log level audit' statement.
Functionality should by all means be identical to that of xtables' AUDIT
target.

So the central element are firewall rules for audit purposes and
NETFILTER_CFG notifications merely serve asserting changes to those
rules are noticed by the auditing system. Looking at xtables again, this
seems coherent: Any change causes the whole table blob to be replaced
(while others stay in place). So table replace/create is the most common
place for a change notification. In nftables, the most common one is
generation dump - all tables are treated as elements of the same
ruleset, not individually like in xtables.

Richard, assuming the above is correct, are you fine with reducing
nftables auditing to a single notification per transaction then? I guess
Florian sufficiently illustrated how this would be implemented.

It does, thanks a lot for the information!

Thanks, Phil
