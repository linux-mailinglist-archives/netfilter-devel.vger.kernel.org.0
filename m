I think so, we can also request inclusion in -stable explicitly.

Yes.

At this time, I am more concerned about new userspace with old kernel.
EINVAL should be returned if user requests wildcard and kernel does
not support.

Will you formally post this patch then? Or you prefer different
approach?

Anyway, coming back to the (forward) compatibility issues in
containers...

Maybe exposing a description of the netlink bus capabilities can help?
I sent a patchset a long time ago, but this never received any
feedback. I think version numbers are tricky.
