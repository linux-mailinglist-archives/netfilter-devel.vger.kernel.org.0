I know, and the example above works if the 'dynamic' flag is omitted.

That would mean the kernel comment quoted above is wrong and should be
patched to say

* @NFT_SET_EVAL: set can be updated from the packet path and stores expressions.

Unfortunately, this seems to contradict various nftables.git changelog
messages which seem to imply that 'dynamic' means

@NFT_SET_EVAL: set can be updated from the evaluation path

i.e., make sure that set provides an ->update() implementation so

'add @set1 { ip saddr }' and the like work.

The core issue is that when saying

   set set1 {
      type ipv4_addr
      size 64
       flags timeout
       timeout 1m
    }

The kernel has no information on how this set is going to be used.
For 'ip saddr @set1' this will just work as all sets implement
->lookup().

But will this work reliably:
nft add rule ... add @set1 { ip saddr }

At this time, it looks like when specifiying the mandatory 'timeout'
flag, the kernel happens to pick the rhashtable backend so it will work.

But I wonder if we're just lucky or if this is intentional, i.e.
'timeout' means that the set can be altered from the packet path.

In any case, this needs to be documented in nft.8, its telling that I
can't be 100% about the intent of dynamic/EVAL even after reading both
nftables.git and kernel implementation.
