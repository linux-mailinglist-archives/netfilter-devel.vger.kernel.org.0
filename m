This effectively ignores most RST packets, which will clog up the
conntrack table (established timeout is 5 days).

I don't think there is anything sensible that we can do here.

Also, one can send train with data packet + rst and we will hit
the immediate close conditional:

   /* Check if rst is part of train, such as
    *   foo:80 > bar:4379: P, 235946583:235946602(19) ack 42
    *   foo:80 > bar:4379: R, 235946602:235946602(0)  ack 42
    */
    if (ct->proto.tcp.last_index == TCP_ACK_SET &&
        ct->proto.tcp.last_dir == dir &&
        seq == ct->proto.tcp.last_end)
            break;

So even if we'd make this change it doesn't prevent remote induced
resets.

Conntrack cannot validate RSTs precisely due to lack of information,
only the endpoints can do this.
