Yes, nfqueue is one way this can happen, changes to resolver libraries
to issue parallel requests have exposed this race for non-nfqueue case
too.

Right, we could add __nf_ct_ext_add() which is unlocked and convert
the additions happening before unconfirmed list insertion there.

But there are additional problems that I forgot:
a) need for one additional lookup after negative result from main table
   (this time in unconfirmed list).
b) Need to asynchronously re-insert the skb at a later time, once
   the racing entry is confirmed.

We can't use the unconfirmed ct as-is, because it may be incomplete.
For instance, the racing skb might not yet have hit the nat table, so
the ct contains wrong NAT info.

I think b) is a non-starter for all of the alternatives, unfortunately.
