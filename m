Would an example of full cone NAT be the following?
  - Site A uses 192.168.100.0/24 internally
  - Site B uses 192.168.100/0/24 internally
  - There is a VPN between the two sites
  - Site A addresses hosts at Site B using 10.168.255.0/24
  - Site B addresses hosts at Site A using 10.168.1.0/24
  - Site A SNATs packets sent from 192.168.100.0/24 to 10.168.1.0/24, and S=
ite B
    DNATs packets sent to 10.168.255.0/24 to 192.168.100.0/24
  - Site B SNATs packets sent from 192.168.100.0/24 to 10.168.255.0/24, and=
 Site A
    DNATs packets sent to 10.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.100.0/24

The result is that packets at either site have a 192.* and a 10.* address, =
and packets in transit between the sites have only 10.* addresses. In short=
, each site uses the same LAN address and cannot ordinarily exchange packet=
s using normal packet routing. But they *are* able to exchange packets by u=
sing full-cone NAT to translate their addresses to and from intermediary LA=
N addresses.

Full cone NAT allows Linux to do the impossible right away.
