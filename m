Secpath is used for input only, no?

I played a bit more with xfrm_interface and noticed that when used,
NF_INET_LOCAL_OUT hook sees the packet (an ICMP reply) only once instead
of twice as without xfrm_interface. I don't think using it should change
behaviour that much apart from packets without matching policy being
dropped. What do you think about the following fix? I checked forwarding
packets as well and it looks like behaviour is identical to plain
policy:

Thanks, Phil
