iptables offers three configurations off the bat:

 - default: extensions are shipped as 124 plugin files

 - ALL_INCLUSIVE: 0 plugin files (instead, code is built into xtables proper);
optional extra .so files (e.g. from xt-addons) can still be loaded from the fs.

 - NO_SHARED_LIBS: as above but dlopen is completely disabled


openwrt patches iptables to the point that all shipped extensions are grouped
into *five* .so files. It's a custom modification, and not upstream,
so if it breaks, one gets to keep the pieces.

I do not really see the point of that patch. There was something about tiny
libcs missing (being compiled without) IPv6 functions maybe 15 years ago. But
neither libxt_*.c nor libip6t_*.c were really vetted for missing C library
functions. Quite frankly, we could just name all plugins in iptables
libxt_*.c and almost nothing would change.
