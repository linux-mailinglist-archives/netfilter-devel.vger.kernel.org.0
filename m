Indeed, I agree there's a blatant bug, I was just wondering how to
solve it.

I found out from notes with an old discussion with Florian what the
problem really was: for concatenated ranges, we might have stuff like:

	'{ 20-30 . 40-50, 25-35 . 45-50 }'

And the only sane way to handle this is as two separate elements. Also
note that I gave a rather confusing description of the behaviour with
"partially overlapping elements": what can partially overlap are ranges
within one field, but there can't be an overlap (even partial) over the
whole concatenation, because that creates ambiguity. That is,

	'{ 20-30 . 40, 25-35 . 40 }'

the "second element" here is not allowed, while:

	'{ 20-30 . 40, 25-35 . 41 }'

these elements both are.

Now, this turns into a question for Pablo. I started digging a bit
further, and I think that both userspace and nft_pipapo_insert()
observe a reasonable behaviour here: nft passes those as two elements,
nft_pipapo_insert() rejects the second one with -EEXIST.

However, in nft_add_set_elem(), we hit this:

	err = set->ops->insert(ctx->net, set, &elem, &ext2);
	if (err) {
		if (err == -EEXIST) {
			if (nft_set_ext_exists(ext, NFT_SET_EXT_DATA) ^
			    nft_set_ext_exists(ext2, NFT_SET_EXT_DATA) ||
			    nft_set_ext_exists(ext, NFT_SET_EXT_OBJREF) ^
			    nft_set_ext_exists(ext2, NFT_SET_EXT_OBJREF)) {
				err = -EBUSY;
				goto err_element_clash;
			}
			if ((nft_set_ext_exists(ext, NFT_SET_EXT_DATA) &&
			     nft_set_ext_exists(ext2, NFT_SET_EXT_DATA) &&
			     memcmp(nft_set_ext_data(ext),
				    nft_set_ext_data(ext2), set->dlen) != 0) ||
			    (nft_set_ext_exists(ext, NFT_SET_EXT_OBJREF) &&
			     nft_set_ext_exists(ext2, NFT_SET_EXT_OBJREF) &&
			     *nft_set_ext_obj(ext) != *nft_set_ext_obj(ext2)))
				err = -EBUSY;
			else if (!(nlmsg_flags & NLM_F_EXCL))
				err = 0;
		}
		goto err_element_clash;
	}

and, in particular, as there's no "data" or "objref" extension
associated with the elements, we hit the:

	if (!(nlmsg_flags & NLM_F_EXCL))

clause, introduced by commit c016c7e45ddf ("netfilter: nf_tables: honor
NLM_F_EXCL flag in set element insertion"). The error is reset, and we
return success, but the set back-end indicated a problem.

Now, if NLM_F_EXCL is not passed and the entry the user wants to add is
already present, even though I'd give RFC 3549 a different
interpretation (we won't replace the entry, but we should still report
the error IMHO), I see why we might return success in this case.

The additional problem with concatenated ranges here is that the entry
might be conflicting (overlapping over the whole concatenation), but
not be the same as the user wants to insert. I think -EEXIST is the
code that still fits best in this case, so... do you see a better
alternative than changing nft_pipapo_insert() to return, say, -EINVAL?
