Yes, at least it's unfortunate that the default fingerprint file
triggers them. We could drop the offending lines, but then again re-sync
with OpenBSD won't be trivial anymore.

From my PoV we may also just ignore the error conditions. Most important
bit here is to not stop on error, at least not when deleting.

Yes, I'll extend the commit message. Thanks for the reminder.
