Yes, I more or less copied from 'reset <obj>' command so they likely
share their bugs. :)

OK. There's yet another bug: Listing is broken if reset rules contain a
set reference. So it needs a cache that contains about everything *but*
rules. I'll also skip on set elements, they're strictly not needed. But
this in turn leads to a suggestion from Eric about a 'reset set'
command - follow-up material, obviously.
