By "splitting" I was actually refering to "expanding", so you're
replying here to my worst-case range-to-rules expansion question.

OK, so there is room to improve the "rule expansion" logic. I didn't
spend much time on that front yet.

Yes, I agree to stick to something relatively simple and good is just
fine.

Would it make sense to you to restrict pipapo to 3 fields until there
is someone with a usecase for this?

This would need another lookup function that can be selected from
control plane path. The set size and the range-to-rule expansion
worst-case can tell us if it would fit into the stack. It's would be
just one extra lookup function for this case, ~80-100 LOC.

OK, then moving to 8-bits will probably remove a bit of code which is
dealing with "nibbles".

Assuming the same concatenation type, larger bucket size makes pps
drop in the C implementation?

Good. BTW, probably you can add a new NFT_SET_CLASS_JIT class that
comes becomes NFT_SET_CLASS_O_1 to make the set routine that selects
the set pick the jit version instead.

OK, good. How would you like to proceed?

Thanks!
