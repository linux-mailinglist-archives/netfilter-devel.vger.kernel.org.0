Yes, I meant wrt. intervals, there is no need for the value to be in
the set, match can also happen via range.

Yes, only those in doc/data-types.txt, namely this:

+++ b/doc/data-types.txt

 The bitmask type (*bitmask*) is used for bitmasks.
 
+In expressions the bits of a bitmask may be specified as *'bit'[,'bit']...* with
+'bit' being the value of the bit or a pre-defined symbolic constant, if any (for
+example *ct state*’s bit 0x1 has the symbolic constant `new`).
+
+Equality of a value with such bitmask is given, if the value has any of the
+bitmask’s bits set (and optionally others).
+
+The syntax *'expression' 'value' / 'mask'* is identical to
+*'expression' and 'mask' == 'value'*.
+For example `tcp flags syn,ack / syn,ack,fin,rst` is the same as
+`tcp flags and (syn|ack|fin|rst) == syn|ack`.
+
+Note that *'expression' 'bit'[,'bit']...* is not the same as *'expression'
+{'bit'[,'bit']...}*.
+The latter form is a lookup in an anonymous set and will match only if the set
+contains a matching value.
+Example: *tcp flags syn,ack* matches packets that have the SYN, the ACK, or both
+SYN and ACK flags set.  Other flags, such as PSH, are ignored.
+*tcp flags { syn, ack }* matches packets that have only the SYN or only the ACK
+flag set, all other flag bits must be unset.
+
+As usual, the the *nft describe* command may be used to get details on a data
+type, which for bitmasks shows the symbolic names and values of the bits.

This contains minor edits only, I don't see anything wrong with the
above and I think that this is a worthwhile addition to the
documentation.

Oh, yes, makes sense to mention that.

Reference is fine.

Yes, its an exception by virtue of a flow being either-or...

If you think it should be documented then maybe it should be added to
the bitmask example, it documents the difference with tcp flags example,
maybe the counterexample can be made there.

(Its not identical, however -- the established,related [ no set ] way is
slightly faster).

Can you just revamp this one patch?  I thin its the one closest
to applicable form.
