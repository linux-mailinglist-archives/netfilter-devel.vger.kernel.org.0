But the filter rules are gone for a short time, leaving e.g. an
ipv6 network we're routing for wide open.

Same for any exposed containers or VMs.
So I'd say as-is the owner flag is harmful for filtering.

I'm fine with adding a flag that keeps the orphaned table around
and allows to (re)take ownership.
