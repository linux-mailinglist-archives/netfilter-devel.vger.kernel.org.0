Let me elaborate a bit more the problem here.

The hook registration happens from the preparation phase (because it
might fail for several reasons) and hook unregistration happens from
the commit phase (because registration from the abort phase is not
possible, since registration might fail). Hence, nf_register_net_hook()
cannot be called from the commit and abort phases, only from the
preparation phase.

I'm assuming that looking at dormant flags from commit/abort phase
to decide what to do.

Let's have a look a several possible scenarios:

Scenario A) batch containing two commands: dorm + wake up

From preparation phase.

- dorm: preparation phase sets the dormant flag (hooks are
        still registered).
- wake up: unset the dormant flag. This needs to skip hook
           registration, because they are already registered.
           (it needs a way to check that hooks are registered).

From commit phase.

- dorm: dormant flag is unset, no-op.
- wake-up: dormant flag is unset, no-op.

From abort phase (reversed), it undoes preparation phase.

- wake-up: set the dormant flag, unregister hooks.
- dorm: unset the dormant flag, register hooks (not possible)

Problems: Needs a function to check if hooks are present.
          abort phase needs to register hooks.

Scenario B) batch containing two commands: wake up + dorm

From preparation phase.

- wake up: unset the dormant flag. This needs to register hooks.
- dorm: preparation phase sets the dormant flag (hooks are
        still registered).

From commit phase.

- wake-up: dormant flag is set, unregister hooks.
- dorm: dormant flag is set, unregister hooks (again).

From abort phase (reversed), it undoes preparation phase.

- dorm: unset the dormant flag, register hooks (not possible)
- wake-up: set dormant flag, unregister hooks.

Problems: commit phase needs try_unregister hook function.
          abort phase needs to unregister hooks.

I can also describe dorm + wake up + dorm, and wake up + dorm + wake
up scenarios.

I also tried looking at the transaction state instead of the dormant
flags, similar problems.

I also tried adding more internal flags to annotate context. I looked
at adding fields to nft_table to count for the number of pending hook
registration / unregistration. It's all tricky.

The patch I posted is addressing the issue by skipping hook
registration / unregistration for dormant flags updates.

What's your concern with the approach I'm proposing?
