Let me rephrase this:

1) process A fetches the ruleset, finds no chain C (no flush job then)
2) process B adds new chain C, flush job is present
3) process B adds the ruleset
4) process A appends rules to the existing chain C (because there is
   no flush job)

Is this the scenario? If so, I wonder why the generation ID is not
helping to refresh and retry.
