At least for systemd use case, there would be a need to allow
add/removal of set elements from other user.

At the moment, table is created by systemd-networkd which will update
the masquerade set.

In case systemd-nspawn is used and configured to expose container
services via dnat that will need to add the translation map:

add table ip io.systemd.nat
add chain ip io.systemd.nat prerouting { type nat hook prerouting priority dstnat + 1; policy accept; }
[..]
# new generation 2 by process 1378 (systemd-network)
add element ip io.systemd.nat masq_saddr { 192.168.159.192/28 }
# new generation 3 by process 1378 (systemd-network)
add element ip io.systemd.nat map_port_ipport { tcp . 2222 : 192.168.159.201 . 22 }
# new generation 4 by process 1512 (systemd-nspawn)

I don't see why this is needed.
Isn't it enough to record the nlpid in the table and set a flag that the table is
owned by that pid?

i.e., (table->flags & OWNED) && table->nlpid != nlpid)?

On netlink sk destruction the owner flag could be cleared or table
could be auto-zapped.
