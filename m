The idea is that the new libnetfilter_queue API provides a set of
helpers for libmnl. Hence, you have access to the netlink socket API
and you use the helpers to build the netlink message.

The netlink sockets allows you to communicate userspace with the
corresponding kernel subsystem. The message you send to the kernel is
composed of two headers, one is the struct nlmsghdr (netlink header)
and then it follows the nfnl header. The payload of the netlink
message is composite of Type-Length-Value (TLV) attributes.

Therefore:

        mnl_attr_put_u32(nlh, CTA_MARK, htonl(42));

is adding the TLV that represents the conntrack mark.

The value is in network-byte-order for historical reasons, there were
an original effort to place netlink message on the network wire, but
at the end of the day this was not used in practise.

So the new libnetfilter_queue API is more low-level, in the sense that
you have more control on netlink aspects, such as the socket
initialization and the message building / parsing.
