For datastructure like bitmap and hashtable, the tuning parameters are
well-known probably and rather trivial for everyone. However, for
composite datastructures, this is not.

In general, I think the developer should better know how to optimize
the tuning of the datastructure based on the description. Rather than
assuming that the user knows how to tune things and exposing n-thousand
knobs for configuring things.

Moreover, if it turns out that we ever get something better than
pipapo in the future to represent this, then we cannot transparently
get rid of this code in favour of the new one. And I'm not telling I
know a better way to do what you're proposing right now :-)

Probably, at some point we can start exposing knobs, but I'd rather
see a bit more discussions on how to provide a good autotuning. By
exposing all knobs, then such discussion might not ever happen?
