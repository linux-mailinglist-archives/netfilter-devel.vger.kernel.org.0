Seems so! :D

I am always inserting me before *pos. The for-loop searches the relevant
group first (by comparing name and family). If found, 'seen_myself' is
set to true. Within that group, xtables_match_prefer() serves in finding
the first element which is less preferred than 'me'. At that point we
break and insert. If no less preferred one is found, due to
'seen_myself' the loop breaks at the first item no longer belonging to
the own group. If the own group is not found at all (i.e., we insert the
first item in that group), the insert is done up front (replacing
xtables_pending_matches value) because we assume more group members to
come and so the for-loop does not have to iterate over all other groups.

Put more simply: I'm not assuming *any* ordering in input, not even
grouped input by name. But I chose the algorithm to optimize for input
which is grouped by name and family and sorted by ascending revision
within groups, as that is mostly the case in in-tree extensions.
