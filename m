Apologies for the colourful language in the previous post. I could see
something was very wrong but was too tired to formulate a reasoned response.

My concern is with the calling sequence of pktb_setup().
There's a detailed explanation in one of the patch reviews I just posted.
As long as you're happy with that bit, commit what you like.
If it would save you time, the following patch applied on top of my initial
patch aligns with what you posted, after making the corrections in my reviews.
You might like to try them and see what you think.
Or, just apply yours and I'll rebase. But that *will* include changing the
calling sequence of pktb_setup().

Cheers ... Duncan.
