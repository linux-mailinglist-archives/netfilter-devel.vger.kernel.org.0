Hi all,

We would like to ask for feedback on a proposed workflow for reporting Linux
kernel bugs found by an LLM-assisted code auditing tool that we have
been developing since earlier this year.

Since February, we have been developing an LLM-driven kernel code auditing
tool called VEGA. It started as a side project, but the results became much
substantial than we expected: VEGA has found hundreds of valid bugs in Linux
kernel.

That immediately created a practical problem: we do not want to dump a large
pile of bug reports onto mail lists and annoy the maintainers.

The first thing we tried was to fix as many as we could ourselves. We
started working with a group of student volunteers. Most of them are
college students, so we have been training them, reviewing their patches,
and trying to build an internal review process before anything is sent to
the mailing list. The goal is to turn these findings into useful fixes, and
also to help new contributors grow into people who can reduce maintainer
workload instead of adding to it.

The process was not perfect. Some patches were not good enough, and we also
made some mistakes early on when deciding what should be called a security
issue.  Our internal review process has been improving with the help of the
community.

Since March, we picked up non-root triggerable bug first and have worked on
fixes for more than 100 validated kernel bugs. we especially want to thank
the students and professor who have helped a lot with this effort.

But the remaining queue is still too large for us to handle.

Recently Jamal pointed out problems around our tags. That made me realize
that we should probably stop treating this as an ad-hoc patch effort and
build something closer to syzbot: public, reproducible, trackable,
deduplicated, and useful to maintainers.

So this mail is an RFC for a VEGA reporting workflow.

The rough idea
==============

VEGA would have a public dashboard, similar to syzbot, and would
send selected bug reports to the relevant kernel mailing lists.

The goal is to send reports that contain enough information for maintainers
or other developers to pick up, understand, reproduce and fix the issue.

For each public report, we expect to include:

  - a description of the bug
  - the tested kernel tree and commit
  - the kernel config and environment
  - the crash log
  - a minimized user-space reproducer
  - the suspected introducing commit
  - a suggested fix patch

The suggested fix patch is meant to reduce maintainer burden. It still need
human review, but hopefully it can save a lot time from building a patch
from scratch.

What will be public
===================

All VEGA findings that we have evaluated as not having major security
impact can be published on the VEGA dashboard. The dashboard would make it
possible to see what VEGA found, whether the issue was reproduced, whether
a fix exists, whether it was reported to a mailing list, and whether it has
been fixed upstream.

For issues that we have validated as having possible serious security
impact, we will not publish it on the public dashboard before going through
the appropriate kernel security process.

Dumping everything onto the mailing list may be annoying. During the initial
stage, reports will be rate-limited and sent manually. We will check for
duplicates against lore/upstream, and make sure the issue is not already
fixed or reported.

Report identity and tags
========================

Each public VEGA report will have a stable identity, similar to
syzbot reports.

One possible format is:

  Reported-by: VEGA <vega+HASH@DOMAIN>
  Closes: <public dashboard URL>

=========

We would like to hear what maintainers think about this before we start
sending these reports.

We do not want VEGA to become another source of mailing list noise. The goal
is to make LLM-based bug finding transparent and useful, and to make sure
the reports come with enough context, reproducers, suggested fixes, and
tracking so that they reduce work rather than create more.

Thanks,
Yuan
