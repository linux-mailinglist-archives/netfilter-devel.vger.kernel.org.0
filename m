Oh, right, it could be 8 bytes too. Let's stick to 4 for simplicity.

Yes, I meant that for the *new* code: k + 32 mod 32 (that is, k) is the
worst case for the new code.

Isn't the already aligned-address k - 4, that is, k + 28? With k + 4,
we would have &scratch->map[0] at k + 8. But anyway:

...yes, the rest is exactly what I meant. I'm not really satisfied of
the paragraph below but maybe something on the lines of:

	/* Align &scratch->map (not the struct itself): the extra
	 * %NFT_PIPAPO_ALIGN_HEADROOM bytes passed to kzalloc_node() above
	 * guarantee we can waste up to those bytes in order to align the map
	 * field regardless of its offset within the struct.
	 */
