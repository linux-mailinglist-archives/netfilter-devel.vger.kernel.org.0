Hm. I think such list could grow up collecitng devices that could not
ever show up again.

I think wildcards should inconditionally show in HOOK_DEVS, otherwise
this tracking becomes tricky?

I am not sure ACTIVE_DEVS or INACTIVE_DEVS is worth in the basechain
notification, since this is merely for diagnostics, just let this
information be listed in the specific command that allows to inspect
what devices are matching the wildcard (to me this is for debugging
purpose only, because if users says tap* then that is all tap devices
will be registered in such basechain/flowtable).

Makes sense.

As said, I would only expose active devices in GETDEV.

For basechain, definitely because one could have a pure hardware
basechain (for offload) while a pure software policy in separated
basechain, placing hardware before software.

Thanks.
