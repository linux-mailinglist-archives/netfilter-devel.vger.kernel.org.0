5.7.0-1.fc33.x86_64
ipset-7.5-1.fc31.x86_64

it's practically the same with 5.6.18 and i found it out by luck what
ruined my boot times that much because i saved the one with 5192 empty

but it does support when you want to add 42000–42999 on the cli and that
works way faster than restore at reboot

if one could restore just the ipset definitions so that you can load the
iptables ruleset and after that load the values would improve the
situation dramatically given that 99% of the ruleset works with empty
ipsets good enough for some seconds

well, that's a nested VMware ESXi within Vmware Workstation where many
things are more expensive

but 9 seconds on a single vcore to restore ipset, iptables, create a
brdige and assign two interfaces to it with a few ethtool commands on
the production vm with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6128 CPU @ 3.40GHz is still
terrible given that the machine don't do anything else

i remember times where i lost 4 ping packets to the machines behind the
firewall but than i added a lot of ports to some ipsets

[root@firewall:~]$  systemd-analyze blame
9.601s network-up.service
