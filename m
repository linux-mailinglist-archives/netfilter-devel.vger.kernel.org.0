It looks like there is more than just a missing retry when
socket-receive returns EINTR. In the code in src/iface.c between lines
87 and 98, EINTR may come from one of two functions:
mnl_socket_recvfrom() and mnl_cb_run(). If it is returned by
mnl_socket_recvfrom(), the correct course of action is to blindly call
that function again. But when it is returned by mnl_cb_run(), the
meaning is different. mnl_cb_run() retruns -1 and sets errno=3DEINTR when=

netlink message contained NLM_F_DUMP_INTR. I assume (though I am not
sure) that NLM_F_DUMP_INTR means that the data that is being transferred
has changed while transfer was only partially complete, and the user is
advised to restart _the whole dump process_ by sending a new NLM_F_DUMP
request message. (Arguably, libmnl ought to report such situation with
some other indication, not EINTR.) In any case, I believe that the
aforementioned code should handle both of these two "need to retry" cases=
=2E

I our tests it looks like we are hitting NLM_F_DUMP_INTR rather then
interrupted socket recv(). I will report back after this is verified.

Best regards,

Eugene
