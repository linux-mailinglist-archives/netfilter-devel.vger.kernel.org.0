My understanding is that the higher protocol might negotiate and
assign both ports for a new connection (I think SIP does this for
RTP, but that is UDP. I don't know any case for TCP).

Yes. It is the confuse deputy attack I was referring to.
Though, it is more of a design options type of questions than a real

I see the reasoning. i.e. sandboxing the process is not more
important than securing communication channels, or securing the peer.

So in a system that let a peer process to pass a socket into a
higher privileged process, when the communication channel or the peer
process is compromised,  e.g. swapping the fd/socket into a different
one that the attacker controls, confuse deputy attack can happen. The
recommendation here is to secure peer and communication.
I agree with this approach in general.  I need to think about how it
applies to specific cases.

In the Landlock kernel doc:
Similarly to file access modes (e.g. O_RDWR), Landlock access rights
attached to file descriptors are retained even if they are passed
between processes (e.g. through a Unix domain socket). Such access
rights will then be enforced even if the receiving process is not
sandboxed by Landlock. Indeed, this is required to keep a consistent
access control over the whole system, and this avoids unattended
bypasses through file descriptor passing (i.e. confused deputy
attack).

iiuc, the design for file and socket in landlock is different. For
socket, the access rules are applied only to the current process (more
like seccomp), while for file restriction, the rules can be passed
into another un-landlocked process.

Agree with the cost/benefit concern.

I think the current design is already good enough for the
decompression program case  in
https://cr.yp.to/unix/disablenetwork.html, as mentioned in G=C3=BCnther's
response.

Great ! Thanks a lot for the discussion !
