Yes, it is supposed to send as many commands as required.

Yes, because errors are assumed to be fatal: it is hard to judge whether 
the error means a failure to enforce a firewall policy or not. Therefore 
the safer approach is used: the human must decide about how to fix it.

Please send your bugreports, better use the netfilter bugzilla. There can 
be easily bugs in libipset which simply didn't occur while used by ipset 
itself.
