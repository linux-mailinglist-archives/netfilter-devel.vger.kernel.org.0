Well, in principle I agree... still we get more and more such
sandboxing stuff (all the bubblewrap, etc.) and even if none of them
may give a 100% safe jail, if they help only in 10% cases it may
already be a win.

Maybe. Though if you think e.g. about XZ, some distros were basically
safe for more or less obscurish reasons.

Well I as said, I have no strong desires to get any of that upstream.=C2=A0

For me personally, the patches from the first series (in particular the
one about not stopping on shutdown/isolation and closing the "pitfall"
of restart) would have been the ones I'd have considered the most
beneficial, but that was already conceived not so enthusiastically. ;-)


I can of course make patches if you really think some of this makes
sense (like e.g. CAP_NET_ADMIN), but then it'll be helpful[0] if you
could just tell me the numbers of the points from my original mail,
which you think are reasonable to even consider and which are way off.

And whether you rather want each set of related hardening options in
one commit, so you can easier pick (we can still squash shortly before
merging) or from the beginning larger patches.

But it shouldn't be considered as me trying to strongly push any of
that getting merged. If you say "no let's leave things as is", I'll
hold no grudge :-)


Cheers,
Chris.


[0] In that case, please keep in mind that some of the sandboxing
options make not much sense without some others:

E.g. ProtectHostname=3Dyes seems to be safely usable with nftables
(assuming it should never try to change the hostname), but if we don't
set (12) or even better run nft it as non-root, it's as per
systemd.exec(5) not really useful.

I tried to mention all these cases in my mail.
