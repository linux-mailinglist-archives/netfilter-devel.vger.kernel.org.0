Subject: [PATCH NOMERGE iptables 1/2] man: xt_set: Reflect current behaviour of counter update and match flags

Since kernel commit 4750005a85f7 ("netfilter: ipset: Fix "don't
update counters" mode when counters used at the matching"), if
a rule doesn't match, counters are not updated, and counter
comparison flags are also evaluated before, and regardless of,
set element matching.

The current description for counter options seems instead to
suggest that counters are updated whenever set elements match,
and the user might assume that comparisons are performed against
updated counter values.

Reflect, instead, the fact that counter flags are updated only
if *rules* (not elements) match, and that packets and bytes
counter specifiers are evaluated against the existing counter
value, before updates (that might not take place).
