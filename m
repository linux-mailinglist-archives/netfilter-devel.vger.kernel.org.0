Hi Jeremy,

I did this in response to nfbz#1729[1] which argued the names are more
descriptive. This is obviously true and since commit b6196c7504d4d there
is no real downside to printing the name if available anymore (--numeric
still prevents calls to getprotobynumber()).

Personally I don't mind that much about changing --list output as it is
not well suited for parsing anyway. I assume most scripts use
--list-rules or iptables-save output which wasn't affected by
da8ecc62dd76. Of course I am aware of those that have to parse --list
output for one or the other reason and their suffering. The only bright
side here is that whoever had to adjust to da8ecc62dd76 will know how to
adjust to 34f085b16073, too. Plus it's not a moving target as there are
merely twelve names which remain in '-n -L' output.

I think it's a mess and there's no clean way out. The current code is at
least consistent between '-S' and '-L' output (iptables-save should not
be "less numeric" than '-n -L'). If it helps, I can work with Eric to
solve the problem for firewalld so Michael will have something to
backport to fix it.
All in all I have not seen many complaints about this change, I expect
few people scraping iptables output and only a fraction doing --list.
In addition to that, I plan on soon having a 1.8.11 release (we're far
ahead already to make backports a pain).

What do you think?

Thanks, Phil
