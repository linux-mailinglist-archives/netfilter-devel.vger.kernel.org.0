So the assumption is that any changes to the ruleset in kernel were also
done to the cache, so we may just bump cache->genid instead of
refetching. In interactive nft, this requires for the last command to
have manually updated the cache as needed though. This is what confused
me. E.g., adding some chains:

- add chain t c2
  - no cache yet, fetch initially, store current genid
  - commit the new chain (kernel bumps genid)

- add cahin t c3
  - local genid == kernel's genid + 1, so skip cache update and bump
    local genid instead
  - commit the new chain (kernel bumps genid)

So I think if NFT_CACHE_RULE_BIT is set, NFT_CACHE_UPDATE must be set as
well to be sure that a previous command updated the rule cache if if was
a rule-related one. Therefore the local genid bump trick should be
allowed only if !NFT_CACHE_RULE_BIT || NFT_CACHE_UPDATE.

This still does not fix for the case at hand, because it doesn't cover
for the fact that cache had been updated but the contained items were
modified in-kernel.

I think 'delete rule' command needs a fix, too: cmd_evaluate_delete()
does not drop the rule from cache. I can't come up with something that
breaks due to that, though.

Yes, NFT_CACHE_REFRESH disables the conditional cache update skipping.
It is overly agressive though: If kernel's genid matches the cache, no
update should be needed.

This is expected: A simple 'add rule' command does not need a rule
cache, so even setting NFT_CACHE_UPDATE would not lead to a consistent
cache. This is fine, we should avoid fetching rules unless really
needed.

Actually no rules at all, as NFT_CACHE_RULE_BIT remains unset.

Only if we start fetching rules for non index/handle 'rule add'/'rule
insert' commands, right? Also, new rules have to be replaced by their
kernel versions in cache to get the handles.
