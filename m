Subject: Re: [PATCH nft 2/3] netlink_linearize: incorrect netlink bytecode
 with binary operation and flags
To:     Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>

To put the point of this spec into words: what's really nasty and
wrong here is that we do not use an operator when we want to perform
an operation on the comma-separated list, but instead, we make it
imply an operation *conditionally* and *implicitly*.

If you look at the spec again, every comma-separated list refers to
only a numeric value, but not whether this value should be used as a
mask or introduce another numeric value (0) for comparison.

For example, there's a reason it's fine to use `! syn` / `!
fin,rst,ack` to refer to `& syn == 0` / `& fin,rst,ack == 0`: the `!`
indicated the operation (and it's fine that it also introduces another
value, since the value never changes: it's always 0).

While I don't see a point in introducing an operator to refer to `&
list != 0`, if you insist on having a shortcut for that, with e.g. `@
syn` / `@ fin,rst,ack` at least things will be "reasonable".

Can you even document it like this with how "shortcuting" is
"beautifully" abused:

    [ == ] list: flags has the same value as list
        != list: flags has different value from list
         ! list: flags has none of the bit(s) in list set (a.k.a.
flags & list == 0)
list_a / list_b: with flags masked with list_b, flags has the same
value as list_a (a.k.a. flags & list_b == list_a)
         @ list: flags has at least one of the bits in list set
(a.k.a. flags & list != 0)

There's something you can't just "shortcut". When you do it wrong, it
does no one any good, but only makes things *seem* neat. Just `tcp
flags syn / syn` is perfectly sensical. It might look bad, but it
doesn't mean that you can do it wrong.

Regards,
Tom
