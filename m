Yes, that's how "wildcards" are implemented. (Hence why a simple
strncmp() is sufficient.)  When Pablo asked about it, I also realized I
could keep the lookup-by-name unless manual search was needed. I even
implemented it but surprisingly couldn't measure a difference. Quoting
myself from another mail here:

As suggested in my other reply, I could implement GETDEV request so
nftables may print either:

| flowtable f {
| 	hook ingress priority filter
| 	devices = { eth* (active: eth0, eth1), test1 (inactive) }
| }

or:

| flowtable f {
| 	hook ingress priority filter
| 	devices = { eth*, test1 } # active: eth0, eth1
| }

The NEWDEV/DELDEV notifications the kernel currently emits will be
printed by 'nft monitor'. This is still useful despite the above to
notify user space if a device is bound/unbound at run-time.

Cheers, Phil
