Hi,

Sorry to jump late onto this discussion, I missed it entirely and just
noticed the new commit. /o\

I believe there was a misunderstanding: How I read Pablo's comments, he
was walking about '-X' with base-chain name explicitly given. If a user
calls e.g. 'iptables-nft -X FORWARD', it is clear that the new behaviour
is intended and dropping any non-standard policy is not a surprise. The
code right now though behaves unexpectedly:

| # nft flush ruleset
| # ./install/sbin/iptables-nft -P FORWARD DROP
| # ./install/sbin/iptables-nft -X
| # nft list ruleset
| table ip filter {
| }

So forward DROP policy is lost even though the user just wanted to make
sure any user-defined chains are gone. But things are worse in practice:

| # iptables -A FORWARD -d 10.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
| # iptables -P FORWARD DROP
| # iptables -X

With iptables-nft, the last command above fails (EBUSY). I expect users
to be pedantic when it comes to unexpected firewall openings or bogus
errors in iptables-wrapping scripts.

IMHO we're fine if chains with non-standard policy stay in place. Yet
this might be racey because IIRC we don't have a "delete chain only if
policy is accept" command flavour in kernel. This would be interesting,
because we could drop a base chain also when it's flushed - just
ignoring a rejected delete if it happens to be non-standard policy.

The safe option should be to delete base chains only if given
explicitly, as suggested by Pablo already I suppose.

Cheers, Phil
