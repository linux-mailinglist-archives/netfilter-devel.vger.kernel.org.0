Ah, OK!

Now I got it: The problem with nat_stmt is that 'snat ip' may either be
'SNAT nf_key_proto' or 'SNAT stmt_expr' and bison carries on until it's
clear. I missed the fact that stmt_expr is allowed in nat_stmt_args.

Thanks for the clarification! Maybe one day I'll finally understand how
bison really works. %)
