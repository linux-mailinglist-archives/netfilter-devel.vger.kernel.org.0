In fact, struct ipt_replace has a zero-length array as last field of
type struct ipt_entry which in turn has a zero-length array as last
field. :)

Embedding is allowed as a gcc-extension. So while my initial approach at
getting rid of the warning in iptables compile-output worked, it didn't
make the header ISO C compatible.

Since gcc in pedantic mode neither accepts zero length arrays nor
embedded structs with flexible member arrays, doing so won't break ISO C
compatibility at least. ;)
