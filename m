I see, I am not sure yet I want to give control to the compiler on the
layout of these structures, I have been using pahole to shrink them
further, specifically struct expr is critical (I have at least one
patch to reduce the size of constant expressions to safe % memory with
very 13.5%. And location for error reporting is still consuming 48
bytes per struct expr.
