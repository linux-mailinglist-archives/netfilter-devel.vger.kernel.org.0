Ah, sorry: NC is "not care", I didn't consider those numbers relevant
given that iptables-nft has caught up to legacy previously already.

1'636'799 is the max number of user-defined chains I can successfully
restore using iptables-legacy-restore. Looks like I dropped the rows'
description while reformatting by accident: the first row of that table
corresponds with test (1), second with test (2) and third with test (3).

So legacy may restore at once ~1.6M chains or ~1.2M comment rules or
~3.5M rules with {s,d}{addr,iface} matches.

The following columns are for iptables-nft with varying BATCH_PAGE_SIZE
values. Each of the (max 1024) iovecs passed to kernel via sendmsg() is
'N * getpagesize()' large.

Cheers, Phil
