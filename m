Yes, there is no semantic change.

Should we also do transparent transformation for

        ct state { established,new }

I have seen rulesets like this too.

OK.

Why only for nft -f and not for "nft add rule" ?

Yes, we can do transformations for that case too.

We can add a new parameter to optimize rulesets, we can start with
something simple, ie.

* collapse consecutive several rules that come with the same
  selectors, only values change.

* turn { 22 } into 22.

* turn ct state {new, established } into ct new,established.

> I think a trivial one such as s/{ 22 }/22/ should just be done automatically.

We could, yes. But I would prefer if we place all optimizations under
some new option and we document them.

I was expecting to have a discussion on this during the NFWS :-).
