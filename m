At least this chunk to discard rules that are orphaned, is needed:

@@ -986,8 +987,13 @@ static int rule_init_cache(struct netlink_ctx *ctx, struct table *table,
                if (!chain)
                        chain = chain_binding_lookup(table,
                                                     rule->handle.chain.name);
-               if (!chain)
-                       goto err_ctx_list;
+               if (!chain) {
+                       if (!ctx->ignore_eintr)

                list_move_tail(&rule->list, &chain->rules);
        }

I remember we used to have a script to check for crashes when writers
race with readers, I cannot find it in tests/shell.
