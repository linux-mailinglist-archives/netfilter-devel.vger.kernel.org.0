Hi Ale,

You raise some interesting points. I'm taking this discussion onto the
netfilter-devel list which I think is more appropriate.

This is loader trickery.

You have written your userspace filter using the deprecated interface, which
uses libnfnetlink under the covers.

That's fine - the Library Setup module documents how to use the deprecated
interface. The current functions use libmnl, but documentation for these is
still under development.

This does look to me like a bug. Perhaps someone on the devel list would have
something to say about it.
