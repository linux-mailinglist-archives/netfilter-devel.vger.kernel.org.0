After reverting:

# ./run-tests.sh testcases/sets/0036add_set_element_expiration_0
I: using nft binary ./../../src/nft

W: [FAILED]     testcases/sets/0036add_set_element_expiration_0: got 139

I: results: [OK] 0 [FAILED] 1 [TOTAL] 1

so I made the test for this fix.

commit 44348edfb9fa414152d53bcf705db882899ddc4e
Author: Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 1 18:34:42 2019 +0200

    tests: shell: restore element expiration

    This patch adds a test for 24f33c710e8c ("src: enable set expiration
    date for set elements").

    This is also implicitly testing for a cache corruption bug that is fixed
    by 9b032cd6477b ("monitor: fix double cache update with --echo").
