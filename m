Subject: [RFC PATCH] doc: use symbolic names for chain priorities
Date:   Sun,  7 Mar 2021 15:43:07 +0100

This replaces the numbers with the matching symbolic names with one
exception: The NAT example used "priority 0" for the prerouting
priority. This is replaced by "dstnat" which has priority -100.

Hello,

this patch has the RFC tag because I'm not sure if the NAT change
mentioned above is actually correct or necessary.

I don't understand how the priority option actually works. The
documentation states that it "specifies the order in which chains
with the same *hook* value are traversed". However, from what I
understand it's not only relevant for the order of multiple
custom hooks but it also maps to the priority used for the
netfilter hooks inside the kernel (e.g. -300 which happens before
conntrack handling in the kernel). Please correct me if this is
wrong.

Assuming the above is more or less correct, I don't understand
why the old rules worked:

    add chain nat prerouting { type nat hook prerouting priority 0; }
    add chain nat postrouting { type nat hook postrouting priority 100; }

Isn't priority 0 "too late" as 0 is also used for filter? Or are
nat and filter types completely separate and the order is only
relevant for hooks of the same type? If so, why does postrouting
require priority 100 (shouldn't the kernel put prerouting before
postrouting automatically)? Or would any value greater than 0
also work as long as it's after postrouting? And why are dstnat
and srcnat set to -100 and 100?

The fact that iptables has separate tables for "mangle" and "raw"
(for which nftables uses the filter type) doesn't help my
confusion. It would be great if you could shed some light on
this.

Regards
Simon
