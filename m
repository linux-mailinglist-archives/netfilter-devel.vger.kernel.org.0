We do not have such a feature, only a request.  The patch was never
applied because we belive a sysctl based approach is not very flexible.

HW can bounce offloaded packets at any time.
SW fallback bounces packets that it cannot handle, currently those
are ip options or ip fragments.

FIN or RST moves flow back to slowpath permanently.
