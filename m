I don't think so, the "flush ruleset" should make the
existing flowtable invisible, no?

Its the NIC driver (ndo_setup_tc), but I do not see how its fixable,
hence this email.

But driver can't know that the (registered) flow block is going
to be unregistered later in the same transaction, so it can't
"suppress" the error.

For SW path (no offload) this works because netfilter core
will be happy to (temporarily) register the software flow bypass
hook a second time.

You can replicate a unrelated but similar error if you create 1k base chains,
then try to "nft -f" the same ruleset; if you prepend a "flush ruleset"
this will fail because we have "reg, unreg" and not "unreg, reg"
ordering (and we have to do it this way to not leave a "no hooks at all"
window) and the temporary 2nd registering brings the core over the
hardcoded limit.

To be fair, I dont have offload capable HW so I hacked up the dummy driver
to add a faux ndo_setup_tc for testing.

As far as I can piece this together this is coming from
flow_block_cb_setup_simple() in mlx5.

Interesting however is that mtk_wed_setup_tc_block() seems to instead
bump an internal refcount.

Is that the expected driver handling in this situation?
If so, I'd ping mlx driver maintainers.

Thanks,
Florian
