That's an interesting idea, implementing it should be easy indeed. I
wonder though if this "takeover" protection is effective: The table not
having an owner yet may be deleted and recreated (with owner flag) by
any other process, effectively this is the same as the "takeover" you
probably want to prevent by limiting the add owner update to tables with
'orphan' flag.

ACK: A table may become orphan only if there was an owner in the first
place and it survives. So 'orphan' flag may well be a virtual one for
user space only based on '(flags & (owner|persist)) && (nlpid == 0)'.

I find it sensible to protect a table only as long as the owning process
remains alive, at least to prevent zombie tables. This raises the
question what shall happen to orphan tables upon 'nft flush ruleset'?
Flush them like a regular one?

I'll give it a try.

Thanks, Phil
