What is generating this sequence of events?  Is #3 just delayed?

Is this after we let a SYN through while conntrack is still in
established state?

That would imply #1 was ignored too, else this should have destroyed
the entry.

Yes, be_liberal is good for this, but nevertheless I'd like to have it
behave correctly out-of-the-box.

Consider sending a new patch to add a be-liberal check for this.

Problem is that if #1 is ignored, then at #3 we can't easily know if
the syn was bogus (ack is for established connection, still alive)
or if there was re-use (ack is delayed).

Do these problematic connections support tcp timestamps?
If so, we might want to track those so we can check if the segment
is older than what we last saw.

Only problem is that this increases conn size by 16 bytes, but that
would be acceptable if that solves the problem.
