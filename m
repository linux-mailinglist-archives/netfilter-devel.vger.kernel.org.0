Can you elaborate? Was that before xt_write_recseq_begin() or after?

Ok, so either ip6_do_table was done or just starting (and it should not
matter which one).

You mean
"private = READ_ONCE(table->private); /* Address dependency. */" in
ip6_do_table did pick up the 'old' private pointer, AFTER xt_replace
had updated it?

The WRITE_ONCE looks correct.

Is that to order wrt. seqcount_sequence?
Do you have a way to reproduce such crashes?

I tried to no avail but I guess thats just because amd64 is more
forgiving.

Thanks!
