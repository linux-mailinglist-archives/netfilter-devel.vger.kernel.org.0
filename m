My concern with this approach is that, in the dynamic ruleset update
scenarios, assuming very frequent updates, you might lose race when
building the cache in stages. Hence, forcing you to restart from
scratch in the middle of the transaction handling.

I prefer to calculate the cache that is needed in one go by analyzing
the batch, it's simpler. Note that we might lose race still since
kernel might tell us we're working on an obsolete generation number ID
cache, forcing us to restart.
