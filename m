I would prefer to update documentation and drop the change for nlattr.

For mnl_attr_ok(), this should be sufficient?

        if (len < 0)
                return false;

to reject buffer larger that 2^31 (2 GBytes) or when length goes
negative (malformed netlink message in the buffer).

BTW, this _trivial_ function is modeled after nlmsg_ok() in the
kernel...

Did you see such compiler warning? If so, post it in commit
description.

Yes, but the early check for negative length prevents this after this
patch, correct?

Makes sense.

Probably I'm getting confused with this large patch description :)
