so _ACTUAL_EXPR is the modern representation, and _RULE_EXPRESSIONS
the old one?

Maybe the opposite is better? I mean, no changes in the
NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS semantics, these are always the expressions that
run in the datapath, and the alternative expression representation is
just for backward compatibility?

Maybe all this can be handled from _USERDATA? I mean, to add the
netlink representation there?

So NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS contains xt compat expression or is it
ACTUAL_EXPR?

Probably you can just add NFTA_RULE_COMPAT_EXPRS? This new attribute
provides a pure xt compat representation? _ACTUAL concept gets me
confused.

What gets me confused is what the kernel actually uses from the
datapath.

Both representations should be dumped, right? In my mind, userspace
just falls back to my proposed NFTA_RULE_COMPAT_EXPRS in case it
cannot decode NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS.

Sorry for taking a while to come back here.
