Somehow my general feeling is that all proposed fixes in conntrack could 
in some cases break other non single-request - single-response UDP 
applications.

Reading about the kubernetes issue as far as I see

a. When the pods run glibc based systems, the issue could easily be
   fixed by configuring the real DNS server IP addresses in the pods
   resolv.conf files with "options single-request single-request-reopen" 
   enabled. 
b. When the pods run musl based systems, there's no such a solution
   because the main musl developer refused to implement the required
   RES_SNGLKUP and RES_SNGLKUPREOP options in musl.

However, I think there's a general already available solution in iptables: 
force the same DNAT mapping for the packets of the same socket by the 
HMARK target. Something like this:

-t raw -p udp --dport 53 -j HMARK --hmark-tuple src,sport \
	--hmark-mod 1 --hmark-offset 10 --hmark-rnd 0xdeafbeef
-t nat -p udp --dport 53 -m state --state NEW -m mark --mark 10 -j DNAT ..
-t nat -p udp --dport 53 -m state --state NEW -m mark --mark 11 -j DNAT ..

Jozsef
