Ok, can I get one more clarification on this "hierarchy"?  Is it roughly
in the order they appear in nf_tables_commit() after step 3?  It appears
it might be mostly already.  If it isn't already, would it be reasonable
to re-order them?  Would you suggest a different order?

Would the generation change id be useful outside the kernel?  What
exactly does it look like?  I don't quite understand the genmask purpose.
