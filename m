Thanks for picking it up, I missed the automerge code being very
similar.

I worked on a patch to move the whole set adjustment to a separate step
after evaluating commands, but it's a bit larger effort as it requires
to combine overlap detection, auto merge and element deletion. With
simple appending new elements in eval phase and reacting upon
EXPR_F_KERNEL and EXPR_F_REMOVE flags, I guess it's possible to update
the whole set in one go.

Cheers, Phil
