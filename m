I guess I was confused by the need for the "&& req->done" part.

AFAIU req->done is always true here.

But the "I already tried this" is already implied by the presence of the
module name?  Or did I misunderstand?

Good, that will prevent infite retries in case userspace requests
non-existent module.

That would be good, thanks!

It triggers instantly for me provided:
1. CONFIG_MODULES=y (with MODULES=n the faulty code part isn't built...)
2. set "sysctl kernel.modprobe=/root/sleep1.sh"
   I found that with normal modprobe the race window is rather small and
   the thread doing the request_module has a decent chance of re-locking
   the mutex before another syzkaller thread has a chance to alter the
   current generation.
