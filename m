qh->data is a pointer which is assigned in nfq_create_queue() at
libnetfilter_queue.c:584. I was never proposing to free what qh->data points to,
only to free any left-over qh structs.

The user cannot access qh->data directly because qh (struct nfq_q_handle) is
opaque.

nfq_destroy_queue(qh) will free qh at libnetfilter_queue.c:619. I'm just
proposing to free qh's for which nfq_destroy_queue was not called. In
nfq_close(h), h->qh_list can only have struct nfq_q_handles if it has anything.

I can still do that. It's an enhancement now.

Yes it could do with updating. My first instinct would be to remove the
nfq_unbind_pf comments and code snippet as I mentioned originally. Kernel 3.8 is
way out of LTS.

But, there have been quite recent emails on the lists from folks who are stuck
with these old kernels owing to having proprietary closed-source binary blobs.

I could leave these old comments and doxygen lines in but with extra lines
highlighting they are for pre-3.8 only. Do you have a preferance?
