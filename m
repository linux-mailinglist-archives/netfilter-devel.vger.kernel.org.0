Your proposed patch would allow to call e.g.:

| nftnl_chain_get_u32(c, NFTNL_CHAIN_DEVICES)

This would return (uint32_t)*(&c->dev_array[0]), I highly doubt we
should allow this. Unless I miss something, it is certainly a
programming error if someone calls any of the nftnl_chain_get_{u,s}*
getters on NFTNL_CHAIN_DEVICES attribute. So aborting with error message
in nftnl_assert() is not only OK but actually helpful, no?

Cheers, Phil
