Well technically all that needs to be done is NAT66 instead of NAT44
within that hack and that limitation vanishes.

If nat64 functionality was added within conntrac itself then it would be
easy to reuse the l7 helpers. If it was anywhere else the l7 helpers
within conntrack would have to be re-implemented as conntrack wouldn't
know the mappings and therefor it probably would be quite hard to do the
rewrites.
Also in regards to FTP not just L7 headers but also payload needs to be
edited on the fly. As it often uses differnt commands for IPv4 and IPv6
(even though the IPv6 ones also support IPv4) and it embeds the IPs as
strings.

EPRT<space><d><net-prt><d><net-addr><d><tcp-port><d>

where "net-prt" is either 1 for IPv4 or 2 for IPv6. and net-addr is the
string representation.
However a client may send the "PORT" command instead...
Also RFC2428 may be helpful in this context.

I think if it was possible to get the nat64 into conntrack it should
also be possible to take care of this more easily as with external
"hacks".


Also in regards to the above code it looks like currently only tcp and
udp are supported. All other traffic appears to just dropped at the
moment instead of just passed through. Is there a particular reason for
this?
