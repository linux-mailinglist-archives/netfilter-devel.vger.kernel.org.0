I think they cover different aspects, so far we have good coverage
for the control plane, which are the tests you are refering to.

Is there any script that pulls dependencies and install them to run
this kselftests?

I'm just brainstorming where to go, and see if you think it can be
useful to start collecting testing/debugging tools that might be not
only useful for this test infrastructure, but for general
troubleshooting.

My only concern is that we might end up with a bit of C code spread
over the test tree for all these tooling. Probably these tooling could
reside in the kernel tree if you prefer.
