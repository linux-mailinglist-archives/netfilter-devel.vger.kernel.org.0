OK, then see below:

Please test it at least against
iptables/tests/shell/testcases/ipt-restore/0004-restore-race_0. You are
reworking a code-path which is hit only in rare cases, Florian did a
great job in creating something that triggers it.

My point is, I don't trust this code:

The call to flush_cache() should free objects referenced in batch jobs.
Note that nft_refresh_transaction() does not care about batch jobs'
payloads, it just toggles them on/off via 'skip' bit.

The only way to make the above work is by keeping the original cache
copy around until mnl_batch_talk has finally succeeded or failed with
something else than ERESTART.

Cheers, Phil
