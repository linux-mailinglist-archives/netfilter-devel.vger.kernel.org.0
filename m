I'm not aware of anyone working on broute for nftables.
Not sure a new chain type is good, it seems better to implement it via
a new expression.

Can't you just override the destination mac to point to the bridge
device itself?

The br_netfilter_broute flag is required, but I don't like a new chain
type for this, nor keeping the drop/accept override.

I'd add a new "broute" expression that sets the flag in the skb cb
and sets NF_ACCEPT, useable in bridge family -- I think that this would
be much more readable.

As this expression would be very small I'd make it builtin if nftables
bridge support is enabled.
