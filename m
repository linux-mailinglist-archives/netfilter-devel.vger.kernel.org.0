Hi Phil,

Picking up on this because I still see:

W: [FAILED]     331/389 testcases/sets/reset_command_0

here, maybe you can merge this change now? 6.5.x -stable will also
enter EoL in one more.

More comments below regarding your open questions.

The only usecase I can find for --stateless is diff'ing outputs
between two delta in time, to see what new elements are added and what
are gone. So I inclined to leave --stateless as is now.

For the reboot case, restoring temporary elements (which were added
via datapath) might make sense to me.

But there are limitations: connlimit is one of them because the
internal state of this datastructure gets losts between reboots.
