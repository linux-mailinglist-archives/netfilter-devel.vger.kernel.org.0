Yes, I was wondering if there is a way to convert the return type
in a different patch.

If its too costly, don't bother.

Sorry, missed that :-(

If thats really a concern. alernative would be to do same thing as
nft_netlink_dump_start_rcu(), i.e. use _RCU as-is and then switch
from rcu to module reference held, plus, in your case, the transaction
mutex.

Actually I like that better because we already use this pattern and
afaics all dumpers call rcu_read_lock for us; i.e.:

callback_that_might_reset()
{
	try_module_get ...
	rcu_read_unlock()
	mutex_lock(net->commit_mutex)
	  dumper();
	mutex_unlock(net->commit_mutex)
	rcu_read_lock();
	module_put()
}

should do the trick.

You can but you need conditional locking in that case.
