Hi Simon,

Priority is only relevant _within a given hook_. So comparing priorities 
of base chains hooked to prerouting and postrouting (as in your example 
above) does not make sense. Please see:

https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Configuring_chains#Base_chain_priority

https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Netfilter_hooks

Hope that clears things up for you.

Best Wishes,
Frank
