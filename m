Hm. I am looking at include/uapi/linux/netfilter_bridge.h and...

#include <linux/in.h>
#include <linux/netfilter.h>
#include <linux/if_ether.h>
#include <linux/if_vlan.h>
#include <linux/if_pppox.h>

I don't understand why all those #include need to be there, this
header file contains only defines an enumeration... git annotate takes
me to:

  607ca46e97a1 ("UAPI: (Scripted) Disintegrate include/linux")

Silly question: Does it break any netfilter userspace software if
#include <linux/if_ether.h> is moved from that kernel header file to
to the non-uapi netfilter_bridge.h header file.

This is userspace, I guess we can replace it with userspace netinet/
header variant.

Agreed, avoiding the configure kludge would be good.
