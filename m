The situation is far from ideal: the original mode (update counters 
regardless of the outcome of the counter matches) worked for almost five 
years. Then the 'Fix "don't update counters" mode...' patch changed it so 
that the result of the counter matches was taken into account, for about 
two years. I don't know how many user is expecting either the original or 
the changed behaviour, but better not change it again. Also, the grammar 
seems to be simpler this way :-).

Could you write a manpage update to describe properly the features?

In my opinion the two flags are mutually exclusive, therefore I dropped
the checking in ip_set_update_counter(). IPSET_FLAG_SKIP_COUNTER_UPDATE is 
taken into account in ip_set_match_extensions() now.

I'll fix it, thanks!
