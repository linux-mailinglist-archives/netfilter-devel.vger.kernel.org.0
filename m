While 128 should suffice for all practical cases (I hope), we could also
count hooks (empty ones twice) in _fill routines and omit the
HOOKLESS_DEVS attribute if the number exceeds 256.

Yes, these kinds of short-cuts tend to kill the flexibility of the netlink
format. We could introduce _HOOK_DEVS_NEW but just like with _HOOK_DEV,
we can't get rid of _HOOK_DEVS in exchange.

ACK.

Please keep in mind we already have 'nft list hooks' which provides
hints in that direction. It does not show which flowtable/chain actually
binds to a given device, though.

Yes, it is definitely more work than the HOOKLESS_DEVS extra attribute,
but both user and kernel space would reuse code from NEWDEV event
support for the new request.

OTOH using it instead of HOOKLESS_DEVS means one more round-trip for
each flowtable and netdev chain being cached in user space.

There is^Wwill be also 'nft monitor' helping with that.

So you're suggesting to either implement GETDEV now or maybe later but
not the HOOKLESS_DEVS attribute for it being redundant wrt. GETDEV?

I prefer the comment format simply because it is easier on the parsers:
The one in nft is already quite convoluted, anyone trying to parse nft
output (yes, there's JSON for that but anyway) will likely expect
comments already.

On top of that, we don't break syntax for older binaries.

We could start by accepting quoted strings there. To not cause too much
fuss, quotes could be limited to wildcard interface names on output (at
least for now).

My maxim would be to use comments for data which is output only, i.e.
useless on input.

Cheers, Phil
