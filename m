Given that both the old and your new version of the test case reliably
trigger on x86_64, I guess it's good enough - I suppose almost all
testsuite runs happen on that architecture and if the test detects a
regression there, it's sufficient for upstream.

In theory, downstream is fine with the test producing false-negatives in
all but one (mandatory) tested arch, but if your patch improves that I
don't see any downsides to it.

I quickly played around with reduced stack size and listing a large
ruleset. Really just a quick test, but I got a segfault in
parser_bison.c. I bet this will be the limiting factor in all attempts
at reducing stack size, bugs aside. :)

Cheers, Phil
