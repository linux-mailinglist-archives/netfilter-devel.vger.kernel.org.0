Rebased here as per your request:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20231024200243.50784-1-pablo@netfilter.org/

I took the freedom to take your Signed-off-by: and Paul's Reviewed-by:
which is not the best way to go, but please acknowledge this is fine
in this exceptional case.

We can handle this via nf.git tree, there were no plans to send a PR
to netdev, but I think these fixes are worth to (try to) get them
there in time for the 6.6 release.

Thanks.
