I agree Lukas use-case is very specific.

However, this is useful.

We have plans to support for NAT64 and NAT46, this is the right spot
to do this mangling. There is already support for the tunneling
infrastructure in netfilter from ingress, this spot from egress will
allow us to perform the tunneling from here. There is also no way to
drop traffic generated by dhclient, this also allow for filtering such
locally generated traffic. And many more.

Performance impact is negligible, Lukas already provided what you
asked for.

And more importantly:

I really think this patchset is _not_ interfering in your goals at all.
