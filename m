Interface names have no spaces, so this patch fixes nothing there indeed.

You do this trick not to escape three times, ie.

| #nft add chain inet t c \{ type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop\; \}

Your trick works fine right now because the argv list is not honored
by the main function, your quotes to avoid escaping the values will
result in:

argv[0] = nft
argv[1] = add
argv[2] = chain
argv[3] = inet
argv[4] = t
argv[5] = c
argv[6] = { type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop; }

This is not a problem because main translates this into a plain buffer
to feed the bison parser for the command line mode.

With my patch, this will still work:

| # nft 'add chain inet t c { type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop; }'

So you can still use quotes to avoid escaping, but quotes are
restricted to the whole command OR to use them to really quote a
string.

So I'm debating if it's worth providing a simple and consistent model
we can document on how to use quotes in nft from the command line, in
this patch:

1) You can quote the whole command to avoid escape characters that
   have special semantics in your shell, eg. { and ; in zsh. Or ; in bash.

2) You do not need to escape quotes anymore as in the example above
   for log prefix.

Otherwise, we are allowing for quotes basically anywhere.

If in the future, we decide to stop using bison for whatever reason
and we rely on argc and argv, this might make things harder for a new
parser. Not telling I have an incentive to replace the parser right
now though.

argc is left untouch, it would need to pass it as a pointer to
getopt_long() to update it. Not related, but getopt mangles argv,
because it reorders options, it is placing them right before the
non-options, so optind points to the beginning of what main passes to
the bison parser. Well actually mangling will not happen anymore if
the patch to enforce options before command is applied (looks like
feedback on the mailing list points to that direction).

Probably not worth the effort and we should start promoting people to
use the interactive interface for `nft -i'. If autocompletion is
supported there, then there would be a real incentive for users to
pick `nft -i'.

Thanks.
