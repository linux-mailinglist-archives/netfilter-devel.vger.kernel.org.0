Yes.

Yes and no.

Why?  Maybe someone wants to collect statistics on encountered packet
size or something like that.

(Yes, they could also use tcpdump of course).

Or maybe someone wants to do QoS markings on packet sizes, so tehy could
have a map like

{ 0 - 64 : 0x1, 65-1280 : 0x2, 1281-1400 : 0x3 } or whatever.

Point is that nft tries to provide only basic building blocks and allow
users to plumb this together.

I would rather see an arithmetic value.

GSO_BY_FRAGS should not occur in forwarding path nornally, but I guess
it might show up with veth coming from a VM, and I indeed forgot about it.
