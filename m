Thanks for the cc. I'm having difficulty catching up with the thread
of conversation, so forgive me if I miss something.

Is there a problem with bf2ac490d28c or just with things that have
come after it?

Hopefully not. In the success case, ask for an ack, get an ack.
Without that guarantee to userspace, we'd need to extend the YNL spec
to say which messages don't honour acks.

Are people reporting ENOBUFS because of ACKs in practice or is this theoretical?

Is the problem due to interplay between ACKs and ERRORs ?

I don't think anyone has successfully specified the expected behaviour
when errors get reported, namely how many acks versus how many errors
could be expected. I know that the YNL python library reports the
first error received and terminates, regardless of how many ACKs were
received.

My guess is that it should be possible to report as many errors as
were received within the receive message length before exiting but I
have not tried to implement that.

I think we should try to specify the behaviour and see if it makes
sense before layering more functionality onto what is there.

I can describe how the YNL python code sees the world, when it asks for ACKs:

1. An ack for BEGIN, cmd, cmd, ... , END in the success scenario.
2. An ack for BEGIN, cmd, cmd, ... up to the first ERROR in a failure scenario.
