"""(libipt_icmp.c):
 * Up to kernel <=2.4.20 the problem was:
 * '-p icmp ' matches all icmp packets
 * '-p icmp -m icmp' matches _only_ ICMP type 0 :(
 * This is now fixed by initializing the field * to icmp type 0xFF
"""

But also:

v1.2.7a-35-gfc9237da missed touching *libip6t_icmp6.c*, so
it was never updated with the same "bug".

In icmp6, --icmpv6-type was (and still is to this date) mandatory, which means
`-p icmp6 -m icmp6` would *not* implicitly go match ICMP(v6) type 0 like its
IPv4 counterpart.

Then, in v1.4.10-115-g1b8db4f4, libipt_icmp.c more or less accidentally gained
XTOPT_MAND (possible spill from IPv6 code), therefore `-p icmp -m icmp` would
also stop implicitly doing ICMP type "any".
