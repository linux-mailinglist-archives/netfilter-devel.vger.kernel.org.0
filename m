On the contrary, good that you mentioned this, I haven't been creative
enough. If we allow a < 0 > start element and keep the start pointer
set to NULL, this ends up being used as it is in ->walk(). Another
problem I found is that on the sequence:

- start element only passed to ->insert()
- API frees the start element
- end element is then passed to ->insert()

we would end up with a dangling ->start pointer, which is again
problematic on a number of operations including walk(). Fixed in v2 by
adding explicit checks (and comments).
