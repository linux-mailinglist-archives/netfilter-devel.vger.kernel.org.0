When creating a new rule with among match, code needs to call
batch_add() to add the NFT_COMPAT_SET_ADD job. So in that direction I
don't see an alternative to passing nft_handle around.

When parsing a lookup expression, we may get by without having to call
__nft_build_cache() as cache might be present already (not sure if I
miss something). If not, nft_handle is mandatory - cache update
functions access many fields in nft_handle.

So when passing cache and builtin_table pointers to rule_to_cs, pure set
lookups should be possible without nft_handle access. We need
builtin_table pointer to identify the right table array item in cache.
With only table name, we need to call nft_table_builtin_find() and that
takes nft_handle as well.

I could give it a try if you still think it's feasible to keep
nft_handle away from nft_xt_ctx.

Thanks, Phil
