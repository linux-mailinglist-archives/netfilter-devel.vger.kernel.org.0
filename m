Uhm ... I thought to have submitted this already, but can't find it on
the list. The updated user space patches are there, no idea what went
wrong. Just (re-)sent:

I'm not sure such netlink data would help. Consider the typical case of
new kernel with ruleset created by new user space. What should happen if
old user space sends a dump request to kernel with insufficient
capabilities? The kernel could merely reject the request, right? If it
dumps and user space sees the dump having unknown capabilities, it could
merely refuse to parse it (or warn and risk crashing).

I fear any more intelligent approach will end as a can of worms we have
to keep maintaining forever. :(

Cheers, Phil
