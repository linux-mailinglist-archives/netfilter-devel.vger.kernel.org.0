OK, let's just not add this anonymous set to the cache.

There is also a test line in tests/py that needs to be turned on that
Phil mentioned (no need for new tests/shell file).

There is a memleak kicking in a few tests after this patch. Turn on
ASAN and run tests/shell/ to catch it.

So re-spin and send v2, thanks.
