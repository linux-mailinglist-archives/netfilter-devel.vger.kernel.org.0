To avoid silently breaking a ruleset. It is a last resort measure for
cases where nft can't translate the ruleset into something meaningful. I
already submitted a patch adding a warning when listing tables
containing compat expressions (status unclear), but a real alternative
to the above would be to abort the listing or to ignore the table.

Listing the ruleset in translated form when iptables-nft can't parse the
translation or without translation but still maintaining syntax to be
parsed without error during a later restore is almost luring users into
doing stupid things.

This will make things worse: People will understand the format and start
using it despite the warnings. This adds a new user base to compat
expressions. I don't dare claiming nobody would start crafting compat
expressions in my zip-dump format, but it's at least a larger obstacle.
:D

If you do, please convince Pablo to not push iptables commit 384958620a.
I think it opened the can of worms we're trying to confine here.

Cheers, Phil
