Given the sample nft input:

| flush ruleset
| add table t
| add chain t c
| ...

First command causes call of cache_flush(), which updates cache->genid
from kernel. Third command causes call to cache_update(). If in between
these two another process has committed a change to kernel, kernel's
genid has bumped and cache_update() will populate the cache because
cache_is_updated() returns false.

From the top of my head I don't see where these stray cache entries
would lead to spurious errors but it is clearly false behaviour in cache
update logic.

The question is how we want to treat rule reference by index if cache is
outdated. We could be nice and recalculate the rule reference which
would require to rebuild the cache including own additions. We could
also just refer to the warning in nft.8 and do nothing about it. :)

OK, so how to proceed from here? I see you've based your patch series
upon an earlier version of mine. If you provide me with a clean version,
I could apply the index reference stuff on top. Or something else?

Cheers, Phil
