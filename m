nft_cmd_chain_restore() already sets NFT_CL_CHAINS.

After the cache is fetched, nft_table_flush() runs before
nft_chain_restore() does.

In Arturo's mail, he doesn't use --noflush. Not sure if this is just his
reproducer or if OpenStack doesn't use --noflush, either. If so, your
fix won't help with his problem.

Arturo, does fixing --noflush suffice for your case? If so, we could
delay the "--flush" case "for later". ;)
