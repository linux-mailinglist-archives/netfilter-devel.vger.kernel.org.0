The flag would be untoggled if hardware offload is not supported. What
problematic scenario are you having in mind that might break?

In any case, there is a need to provide a way to tell the user if the
hardware offload is actually happening or not, if not what I suggest,
then propose a different way. But user really needs to know if it runs
software or hardware plane to debug issues.
