On embedded systems, in my experience, even in the post-modern era,
it's quite common to run kernels without support for networking
namespaces, or a busybox build without the unshare(1) applet (which was
implemented not so long ago, in 2016). And one might want to run tests
there because of some specific peculiarities (say, endianness, word
size, or just debugging).

Perhaps more commonly, Python bindings for unshare() might not be
installed.

The check is quite straigthforward, so I would rather add it.

Yes, it's what the example I quoted does. Well, I hope you meant the
same thing. :)
