Ah, now that I reread your question, I finally got it. And you're right:
If DST occurs, time values will change. This is clear from looking at
hour_type_print(): Whatever the kernel returned gets cur_tm->tm_gmtoff
added to it. Here, this is either 3600 or 7200 depending on whether DST
is active or not.

The other alternative would be to make kernel DST-aware, I don't think
that's the case.

Cheers, Phil
