Dear netfilter contributors,

I would like to use today's "I Love Free Software Day" [^1] to thank you
all for your outstanding, long-term work on netfilter and its
accompanied projects! You are the foundation for many of the
applications on my system [^2], and yet your work is often less known to
"normal" users.

However, you keep on going and make all the other great Free Software
applications possible, and that deserves a lot of gratitude. Thank you
all so much!

Best,
Max
