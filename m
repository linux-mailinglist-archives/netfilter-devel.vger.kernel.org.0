These are local commit IDs? Would it be possible to list with upstream
commit IDs for easier review?

I can see json fixes, these should be good too.

Did you run current tests/shell on git HEAD with these? Several
times? With 6.1 kernel? Did you review these candidates one by one?
Is looking at Fixes: tag enough (maybe some of these fix have some
dependencies? Not all the patches I placed in the 1.0.6.y branch have
Fixes: tag.

Sorry for being nitpicking again: I spend a bit of time collecting
these fixes, identifying those that fix tests/shell specifically.
Making sure that bisectability is not broken. Some of these above
might fix tests/py with -j with current git HEAD (that is missing on
my side).

I also tried to keep it minimal, and that was already 41 patches, but
I am fine with expanding the set, no issue.

Probably you can rebase 1.0.6.y, add these by one to where they
belong, compile, run tests and integrating them into timeline is
consistent.

Or am I again asking for too much? If an issue occur with 1.0.6.y, it
should good to git HEAD and 1.0.6.y do not different too much (at
least I also tried this with -stable Linux kernel patches, backporting
dependency that would make it easier to integrate future fixes in
latest release).

Thanks.
