Thanks, we should include this list in the next series.

Good point!  I don't know well MPTCP but I think you're right.  Given
it's close relationship with TCP and the fallback mechanism, it would
make sense for users to not make a difference and it would avoid bypass
of misleading restrictions.  Moreover the Landlock rules are simple and
only control TCP ports, not peer addresses, which seems to be the main
evolution of MPTCP.

We need to take a closer look at the other stream protocols indeed.

Indeed.  The main issue was with the semantic/definition of
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_NET_{CONNECT,BIND}_TCP.  We need to synchronize the
code with the documentation, one way or the other, preferably following
the principle of least astonishment.

This "fix" needs to be backported, but we're not clear yet on what it
should be. :)

The documentation and the initial idea was to control TCP bind and
connect.  The kernel implementation does more than that, so we need to
synthronize somehow.
