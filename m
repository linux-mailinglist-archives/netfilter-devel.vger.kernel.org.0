Thanks.  Another bug report about this problem arrived moments ago,
this time 'add rule filter dynamic'

Whats worse is that 3rd party tool created a chain with that name.

So I fear we can't really release a new nft version without a new
scanner that passes 'string' outside of rule context.

Phils patch makes this work but breaks the test suite.

Not sure this is a good way to go, it looks rather fragile.

Seems we need allow "{" for "*" and then count the {} nests so
we can pop off a scanner state stack once we make it back to the
same } level that we had at the last state switch.
