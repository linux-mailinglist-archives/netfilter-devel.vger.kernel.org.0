I think there are two separate questions here:

(a) I think it is OK that it is *possible* to allocate 40kB of kernel
    memory.  At least, this is already possible today by calling
    landlock_add_rule() repeatedly.

    I assume that the GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT flag is limiting the
    potential damage to the caller here?  That flag was added in the
    Landlock v19 patch set [1] ("Account objects to kmemcg.").

(b) I agree it might be counterintuitive when a single
    landlock_add_rule() call allocates more space than expected.

Mickaël, since it is already possible today (but harder), I assume
that you have thought about this problem before -- is it a problem
when users allocate more kernel memory through Landlock than they
expected?


Naive proposal:

If this is an issue, how about we set a low limit to the number of
families and the number of types that can be used in a single
landlock_add_rule() invocation?  (It tends to be easier to start with
a restrictive API and open it up later than the other way around.)

For instance,

* In the families field, at most 2 bits may be set.
* In the types field, at most 2 bits may be set.

In my understanding, the main use case of the bit vectors is that
there is a short way to say "all IPv4+v6 stream+dgram sockets", but we
do not know scenarios where much more than that is needed?  With that,
we would still keep people from accidentally allocating larger amounts
of memory, while permitting the main use case.

Having independent limits for the family and type fields is a bit
easier to understand and document than imposing a limit on the
multiplication result.

Sounds good to me. 👍
