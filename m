Not after confirmation though.

Oh, thats a fair point (dying list), had not considered that.

So this needs fixing in any case.

But conntrackd is still borken.
It can't rely on id recycling  -- it will just take a lot
longer before it starts to fill up.

No, not if we allow using the function before confirmation, the tuple
can also change in original dir when e.g. queuing before NAT hooks.
