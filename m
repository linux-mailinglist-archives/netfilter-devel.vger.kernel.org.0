It is true that distros commonly go with upstream default. When the 
upstream default is on "auto" however, it becomes a distro default,
which, due to a blank recipe, quickly becomes "no-documentation".
(Because of this, openSUSE was embarassingly not building libmnl-doc.)

As to whether that is an impediment to creating libmnl-exercising 
software, I cannot say.

Having worked extensively with wxWidgets (also doxygenated) in the past 
however, I found that when the API is large, needs frequent lookup, 
documentation has many pages, and online retrieval latency becomes a 
factor, I prefer a local copy as a quality-of-live improvement.

Well, not quite.

Removals are a powerful action that is seldomly undone at the distro
levels, so it can be regarded as the final say (well, in "95% of
cases"). Think of:

* deprecated C APIs (distros would rather patch consumer programs to
  work with the new ones)

* GNOME desktop, which is infamous for removing stuff due to
  confusion ([1])
[1] https://medium.com/@fulalas/gnome-linux-a-complete-disaster-feb27b13a5c2

Hiding stuff behind a configure knob is not a removal though,
so it is not too big a deal.

                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The way it's phrased makes those users users of the libmnl API (i.e.
developers), and documentation is warranted.

(The following statement would be more accurate:

>Most users of this software are
>building it because it is a dependency for someone else's software

Anyway, looking at what distros _are_ doing is an indicator what
"users" (intermediate consumers, or users at the end of the build
chain) desire and what is worth doing upstream somehow.

* ICU manages documentation separately; in a sense you could see
  this as --enable-doc=no. The ICU APIs are however apparently
  complicated enough that documentation is desirable to have
  available, and so you do find libicu-doc/icu-doc in distros.

* the closer a software is to the bootstrap core, and the more
  outrageous the build requirements for some (sub)component(s) are,
  there more likely it is for those (sub)component(s) to be built in
  a two-phase build or be completely omitted due to complexity.

	* texlive
	* pandoc
	* ant/maven
	* rust/ghc/go

docbook/asciidoc seems right on the edge (because of its potential
to depend on a latex backend), but doxygen seems easy.
