Would you help me get better the documentation for the new
libnetfilter_queue API? I'll be trying to address your questions
timely in case you decide to enroll in such endeavor.

Are you refering to libnfnetlink or libnetfilter_queue in this case?
If you insist on documenting libnfnetlink, I'll be fine with it, no
worries.

Yes, there is still code in the libraries that refer to libnfnetlink.
Replacing some of that code should be feasible via libmnl, it is a
task that has been in my TODO list for long time. There's always
something with more priority in the queue.
