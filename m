Also note that the rule in kube-proxy that adds physdev/physdev-is-in
has the comment:

// This is imperfect in the face of network plugins that might not use
a bridge, but we can revisit that later.

and it clearly doesn't work when the network plugin doesn't use a
bridge interface for containers, which is a lot of them. In fact, that
rule should instead be rewritten upstream to use "-s !<ClusterCIDR>" or
something rather than rules about a network interface that may/may not
exist.

IMHO this is really an issue in kube-proxy (code was added in 2015)
that hasn't been cleaned up since Kubernetes started supporting more
diverse network plugins.
