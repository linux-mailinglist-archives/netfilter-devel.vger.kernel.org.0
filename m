Current variant is performed in every TEST_F() method. I assume that
this is required in order to not make a mess by combining the
ruleset_attr and several rule structures with the operation of creating
ruleset. WDYT?

I don't think replacing
	if (variant->sandbox == TCP_SANDBOX)
with
	if (is_tcp_sandbox(variant))
will change anything, this condition is already quite simple. If
you think that such helper is more convenient, I can add it.

I agree.. using 3 external booleans to control behavior of the
test is really messy. I believe the best we can do to avoid this is to
split "test_restricted_net_fixture()" into few independent tests. For
example we can turn this call:

	test_restricted_net_fixture(_metadata, &self->srv0, false,
		false, false);

into multiple smaller tests:

	/* Tries to bind with invalid and minimal addrlen. */
	EXPECT_EQ(0, TEST_BIND(&self->srv0));

	/* Tries to connect with invalid and minimal addrlen. */
	EXPECT_EQ(0, TEST_CONNECT(&self->srv0));

	/* Tries to listen. */
	EXPECT_EQ(0, TEST_LISTEN(&self->srv0));

	/* Connection tests. */
	EXPECT_EQ(0, TEST_CLIENT_SERVER(&self->srv0));

Each test is wrapped in a macro that implicitly passes _metadata argument.

This case in which every access is allowed can be wrapped in a macro:

	TEST_UNRESTRICTED_NET_FIXTURE(&self->srv0);

Such approach has following cons though:
* A lot of duplicated code. These small helpers should be added to every
   test that uses "test_restricted_net_fixture()". Currently there
   are 16 calls of this helper.

* There is wouldn't be a single entity that is used to test a network
   under different sandbox scenarios. If we split the helper each test
   should care about (1) sandboxing, (2) running all required tests. For
   example TEST_LISTEN() and TEST_CLIENT_SERVER() could not be called if
   bind is restricted.

For example protocol.bind test would have following lines after
"test_restricted_net_fixture()" is removed:

	TEST_UNRESTRICTED_NET_FIXTURE(&self->srv0);

	if (is_restricted(&variant->prot, variant->sandbox)) {
		EXPECT_EQ(-EACCES, TEST_BIND(&self->srv1));
		EXPECT_EQ(0, TEST_CONNECT(&self->srv1));

		EXPECT_EQ(-EACCES, TEST_BIND(&self->srv2));
		EXPECT_EQ(-EACCES, TEST_CONNECT(&self->srv2));
	} else {
		TEST_UNRESTRICTED_NET_FIXTURE(&self->srv1);
		TEST_UNRESTRICTED_NET_FIXTURE(&self->srv2);
	}

I suggest leaving "test_restricted_net_fixture()" and refactor this
booleans (in the way you suggested) in order not to lose simplicity in
the testing:

	bool restricted = is_restricted(&variant->prot,
		variant->sandbox);

	test_restricted_net_fixture(_metadata, &self->srv0,
		(struct expected_net_enforcement){
		.deny_bind = false,
		.deny_connect = false,
		.deny_listen = false
	});
	test_restricted_net_fixture(_metadata, &self->srv1,
		(struct expected_net_enforcement){
		.deny_bind = false,
		.deny_connect = restricted,
		.deny_listen = false
	});
	test_restricted_net_fixture(_metadata, &self->srv2,
		(struct expected_net_enforcement){
		.deny_bind = restricted,
		.deny_connect = restricted,
		.deny_listen = restricted
	});

But it's really not obvious design issue and splitting helper can really
be a better solution. WDYT?

Agreed, this is a best option for refactoring.

I've also tried adding access_mask field to the service_fixture struct
with all accesses allowed by default. In a test, then you just need to
remove the necessary accesses after sandboxing:

	if (is_restricted(&variant->prot, variant->sandbox))
		clear_access(&self->srv2,
			     LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP |
				     LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP);

	test_restricted_net_fixture(_metadata, &self->srv2);

But this solution is too implicit for the helper. Passing struct would
be better.
