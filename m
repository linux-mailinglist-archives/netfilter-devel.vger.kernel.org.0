This is a recurring issue, iptables testsuites suffer from this problem
as well. There it was solved by running everything in a dedicated netns:

iptables/tests/shell: Call testscripts via 'unshare -n <file>'.
iptables-test.py: If called with --netns, 'ip netns exec <foo>' is
added as prefix to any of the iptables commands.

I considered doing the same in nftables testsuites several times but
never managed to keep me motivated enough. Maybe you want to give it a
try?

Cheers, Phil
