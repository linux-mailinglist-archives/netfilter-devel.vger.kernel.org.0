No, I think your patch is fine. I wasn't sure what happens if man_MANS,
EXTRA_DIST, etc. get enclosed by the conditional. Matt's patch
explicitly removed the conditionals around man_MANS.

I tried 'make dist' after configure with --enable-man-doc and the
generated tarball's build system seems to behave fine (man pages are
included, not built again and also installed from 'make install').

So for your patch:

Thanks, Phil
