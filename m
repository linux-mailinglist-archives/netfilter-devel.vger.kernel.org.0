I do not quite understand why we need socket_layers. Without it,
user can set (i64)(-1) to type or protocol whenever he wants. While
transforming triplet to a key we can replace (i64)(-1) with some
constant (e.g. (1 << type_bits - 1) for the type if type_bits = 8 and
(1 << protocol_bits - 1) for the protocol if protocol_bits = 16).
