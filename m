Valid handles are monotonic starting at 1. Using 0 as a replacement is
too simple?

Just put the bulk change into a second patch?

Why not just drop the whole metainfo object? A dedicated test could
still ensure its existence.

Also, scoping these replacements to line 1 is funny with single line
input. Worse is identifying the change in the resulting diff. Maybe
write a helper in python which lets you more comfortably sanitize input,
sort attributes by key and output pretty-printed?

In general, the long lines in your scripts make them quite hard to read.
Any particular reason why you don't stick to the 80 columns maxim?

Cheers, Phil
