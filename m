That's another possibility to explore.

Just make sure there's sufficient context around to rebuild the
expression. Think of more complex fields that require bitmask
operations.

I'm not advocating for storing the string. This was just a quick PoC
given the discussions after NFWS, and I wasn't sure everyone was on
the same page after it.

I agree with you in that the string is not the way to go.

Please, go ahead explore that possibility. I'd try with payload
expressions, which are the most complex one. For thing like meta, it
should be simple to follow the approach you describe. Thanks.
