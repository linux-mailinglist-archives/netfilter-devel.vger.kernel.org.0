Did you consider to change this so that if any of the prefetches fail
the entire chain evaluation stops right then and there?

I'd imagine that userspace would be conservative in what to
prefetch, so candidates would be

ip saddr/daddr, protocol, meta iifname/iif/oifname/oif and so on.

I'm not sure its really needed to add the extra runtime tracking.

Or did you expect userspace to also ask for prefetch for say, vlan tags
where we have to cope with 'partial' ruleset matches?

Alternatively the prefetches could be restricted to the network header in
which case they'd never fail and eval loop could always rely on the
registers to be valid.

Would simplify the implementation.  Just asking/wondering.

The only problem I see is with payload mangling, e.g.

'ip daddr set 1.2.3.4' or similar, but I guess the onus is on
userspace to not ask for a prefetch in this case?

OK.

Ouch :)

I had hoped we don't have to increment jumpstack usage again.

Is there a way to avoid this?
For example by either requiring that the prefetched registers
are not scribbled over or by re-running the 'prefetch' on jump
returns?

Nice, thanks Pablo!
