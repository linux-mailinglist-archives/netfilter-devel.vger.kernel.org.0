Hello,

Thanks for writing up the example for an incoming TCP connection ! It
helps with the context.

Since I'm late to this thread, one thing I want to ask:  all the APIs
proposed so far are at the process level, we don't have any API that
applies restriction to socket fd itself, right ? this is what I
thought, but I would like to get confirmation.

That is an interesting aspect that might be worth discussing more.
seccomp is per syscall, landlock doesn't necessarily follow the same,
another design is to add more logic in Landlock, e.g.
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_PROTOCOL which will apply to all of the socket
calls (socket/bind/listen/accept/connect). App dev might feel it is
easier to use.

TCP server is an interesting case. From a security perspective, a
process cares if it is acting as a server or client in TCP, a server
might only want to accept an incoming TCP connection, never initiate
an outgoing TCP connection, and a client is the opposite.

Processes can restrict outgoing/incoming TCP connection by seccomp for
accept(2) or connect(2),  though I feel Landlock can do this more
naturally for app dev, and at per-protocol level.  seccomp doesn't
provide per-protocol granularity.

For bind(2), iirc, it can be used for a server to assign dst port of
incoming TCP connection, also by a client to assign a src port of an
outgoing TCP connection. LANDLOCK_NET_BIND_TCP will apply to both
cases, right ? this might not be a problem, just something to keep
note.

For this approach, LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_PROTOCOL is a better name,
so dev is fully aware it is not just applied to socket create.
