Agree, thats even better, thanks!

Yes, insertion isn't parallel for same netns.

Yes, exactly, we should only reject what either
1. would crash kernel
2. makes obviously no sense (missing or contradiction attributes).

anything more than that isn't needed.

Yes.  If such 'single element with no end interval' can't happen or
won't cause any problems then no action is needed.
