I won't comment on the above, as it seems like a generic issue with
porting GNU/Linux to Morello, not an iptables-specific one.

I can't reproduce this here.

What './include/linux/ip.h' is that? It's not in iptables.git. On my
system, /usr/include/linux/ip.h is basically identical to
include/uapi/linux/ip.h in my clone of linux.git.

Yeah, we cache needed kernel headers in iptables.git.

Did you retry using gcc? I personally don't use --with-kernel/ksource,
so from my very own perspective, this feature is unused and untested. ;)

These are bugs IMO. Kernel headers are supposed to be compatible, so one
should not have to adjust user space for newer headers - the problem
with xt_connmark.h is an exception to the rule in my perspective.

It's odd that Jack apparently preferred to copy that enum into the
source instead of updating the cached header. Oddly, he added the
definiton of struct xt_connmark_tginfo2 to the cached header in the same
commit.

They are there for compatibility reasons, mostly to gain some
independence from host systems compiling the sources.

If it helps you, feel free to submit a patch updating the cached
xt_connmark.h and dropping said enum from libxt_CONNMARK.c. Same for
other issues you noticed. In doubt just send me a report and I'll see
how I can resolve things myself.

Thanks, Phil
