To keep host-to-host comunication on the same queue, for ftp, sip and
other highlevel protocols where a logical connection consists of
multiple tcp/udp flows.

The latter.  I will add arbitrary hash keying to nft, its currently
only missing from the frontend.

Will put you in CC when its done.

With nft this will soon be possible:

queue num jhash ip daddr . tcp sport . tcp dport mod 16

... which will queue to 0-15.

I don't think we need code changes to the xtables backend.
