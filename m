Yes, incremental updates are an issue. Another possibility is to add
support for static rulesets, so there is a simple way for userspace to
recycle registers (this would be fully performed from userspace).

And users can still inject raw bytecode to make their own programs. We
have been discussing that dumping a listing with bytecode that cannot
be interpreted is an option to deal with "forward compatibility",
similar approach could help deal with this.

If your concern is the register tracking from the kernel, I am not
pursuing that approach anymore and I can make a patch to ditch it
after this series.
