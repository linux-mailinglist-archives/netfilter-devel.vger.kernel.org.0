Not quite, let me try to put this more clearly:

* Dump A:
  | *filter
  | :FOO - [0:0] # flush chain FOO
  | -X BAR       # remove chain BAR
  | COMMIT

* Dump B:
  | *filter
  | -A FOO -j BAR # reference BAR from a rule in FOO
  | COMMIT

* Kernel ruleset:
  | *filter
  | :BAR - [0:0]
  | COMMIT

* Process A:
  * read dump A
  * fetch cache

* Process B:
  * read dump B
  * fetch ruleset
  * commit to kernel

* Process A:
  * skip flush chain FOO job: not present
  * add delete chain BAR job: chain exists
  * commit fails (genid outdated)
  * refresh transaction:
    * delete chain BAR job remains active
    * genid updated
  * commit fails: can't remove chain BAR: EBUSY

I realize the test case is not quite effective, ruleset should be
emptied upon each iteration of concurrent restore job startup.

Cheers, Phil
