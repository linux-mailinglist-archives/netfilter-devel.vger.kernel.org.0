I think this makes sense.  ChomeOS can use it at the process level:
disable network, allow VSOCK only, allow TCP only, etc.

Do you want to add "int protocol" ? which is the third parameter of socket(=
2)
According to protocols(5), the protocols are defined in:
https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml

It is part of IPv4/IPV6 header:
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791.html#section-3.1
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8200.html#section-3

also bind, connect, accept.
