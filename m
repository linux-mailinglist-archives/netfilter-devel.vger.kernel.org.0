Packets either see the old table or the new table, no intermediate
ruleset state is exposed to packet path.

Could you specify kernel and userspace versions? Rules are not 'lost'
when restoring large rulesets.

Why are you placing COMMIT in every few rules 20 000 rules?

iptables is handling very large rulesets already.

Could you please specify what other tool are you refering to?

iptables-restore is the best practise to restore your ruleset.

You should also iptables-restore to perform incremental updates via
--noflush.
