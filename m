No, it won't be called.

We can do two things:
1. Assign the tw sk to skb->sk, then its handled by
   tcp_timewait_state_process() in tcp stack.

Problem is that after the tw sk was handled, tcp stack won't find
a listener socket if the tproxy service is running on a different port.

2. Assign the listener socket to skb->sk (this is whats done now).

> So I guess now, basically we would leak away the tw socket if we do not call put in tproxy?

We could just drop the reference, but then, as far as i can see, we end
up with two identical connection entries in the ehash table.
