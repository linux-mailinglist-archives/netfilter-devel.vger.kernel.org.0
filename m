Probably was out of bounds in state->indescs[MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH].

In my opinion, there isn't, unfortunately. That's why it took me quite some=
 time to fix. Let me explain:

The data structure the original code is trying to achieve is a stack of inp=
ut descriptors, where one entry in that stack is one level of include. This=
 stack is implemented using the indesc_idx variable and the indescs and fd =
array.

Unfortunately, there is an issue with that design for glob includes: glob i=
ncludes add all the discovered files to that stack at once (in reverse alph=
abetic order so the parsing happens in alphabetic order). The bound check f=
or the static array incorrectly leads to the error message that the maximum=
 inclusion depth is reached. However, removing that check alone will result=
 in out of bound access of both fd and indescs arrays)

So basically, in order to apply patch 5/7, you need 2/7 and 4/7 (and 3/7, w=
hich is minor refactoring) to get rid the static arrays.

As an example, the test supplied in patch 1/7 only has one level of inclusi=
on, but adds all the files to the stack, so the static arrays will overflow=
.

As a side note, the stack implementation is incorrect, both in the original=
 code and after patch 5/7 is applied (since it's a minimal patch, as you pr=
eviously ask). The stack implementation is fixed in patch 6/7. That specifi=
c patch is however unrelated to the include depth problem. I believe howeve=
r that it's the correct fix of bug #1383, and should be applied in order to=
 have a sane data structure.

Does that help?
