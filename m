Thanks for the forensics.

One could extend icmp6 match (in kernel and user space) to support this
"any" type, though it seems not guaranteed the value 255 won't be used
for a real message at some point. So a proper solution was to support type
ranges like ebtables does. Then "any" type is 0:255/0:255.

Apart from the above, the three patches of this series should be fine,
right?

Thanks, Phil
