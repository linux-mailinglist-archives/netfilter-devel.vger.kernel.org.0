No, but libnftnl can't known (and should not care) if nftables can
eat the value provided.

i.e., 'incomplete' means 'there were attributes that I did not understand',
nothing more.

How so?

But thats up to higher level tool, i.e. nftables?

I don't think libnftnl should try to guess if nftables can make
sense of the rule provided (or set, element, etc).

Yes, kinda like objump/readelf.
