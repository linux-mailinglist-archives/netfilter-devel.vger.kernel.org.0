Oh, I got it, thanks!
It will be great to find a way how to generalize this helpers. But if
we won't come up with some good design, it will be really better to
simply inline them. I added a mark about this in code refactoring issue
[1].

This check is probably really useful for validating code changes.

Thank you! Discussing refactoring ideas before actually implementing
them sounds really great. We can collect multiple ideas, discuss them
and implement a single dedicated patchlist.

Issue: https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/34.
