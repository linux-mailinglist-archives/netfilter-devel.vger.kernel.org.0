So what will happen to http://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/libnetfilter_queue/ ?
I kind of like the autogenerated directory index to look at
(not scripted, really just as a human). It provides versions and release
dates in one view and you can just pick up any one of them (for historic
research purposes or whatever), without having to engage in a conversation with
the rsync command line.

Such a dirindex could also be provided by www.netfilter.org, considering
the shutdown plans of the ftp service (or the ftp host itself?).
