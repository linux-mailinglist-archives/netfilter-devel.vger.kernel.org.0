I like it.  I mean, its up to distros to package this, I guess
most of them will place this into some extra doc sub-package.

$ man 3 ssl-<tab>
zsh: do you wish to see all 416 possibilities (70 lines)?

... so there are libraries that do this.
Also, from what I understand, there is not a single man-page per
function, the extra ones are just aliases.
