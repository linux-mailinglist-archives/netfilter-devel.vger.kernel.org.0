LGTM.

For patch 13-16, you could display a warning for people to fix their
scripts, so this particular (strange) behaviour in some cases can be
dropped (at least, 13-15 look like left-over/bugs). For the
check_inverse logic, I'd suggest to display a warning too, this is
what it was done in iptables time ago to address this inconsistency.

I'd probably keep back patch 17/17, the max chain name length was
reduced by when the revision field was introduced and this resulted in
no issue being reported.
