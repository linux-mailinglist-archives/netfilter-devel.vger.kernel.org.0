It does not require a container update, merely the host (or whatever
runs the newer iptables-nft binary) must be adjusted. The idea is to
provide the ruleset in a compatible way so old userspace will parse it
correctly.

But it requires to update the "old iptables binaries", no? If so, are
they still "old" then? ;)

That's correct. Both these limitations apply to legacy iptables as well,
and there's a third one, namely new match/target revision.

I could introduce a flag for extensions to disqualify them for use with
--compat if required. On the other hand, new extensions (or revisions)
are not as common anymore since we instruct people to add new features
to nftables instead.

During NFWS, Florian suggested to just add the rule in textual
representation to userdata. Though this is ugly as there are two
different formats (save and print) so user space has to parse and
reprint the rule.

Then I revived my "rule bytecode for output" approach and got it working
apart from lookup expression. But finally you axed it since it requires
kernel adjustments.

From my perspective though, all solutions divide into good and bad ones:
The bad ones are those requiring to touch the old binaries. So if
acceptable, I'd much rather go with any of the "good" ones even though
it has obvious drawbacks.

No worries! All this could be clarified over the course of two beers in
a pub. This medium is less lossy, though. :D

Cheers, Phil
