Hi Pablo,

From my point of view, it's the best approach among the bad ones (i.e.,
those not providing compatibility for old binaries out of the box).

It is. I had your concerns regarding crafted compat payload in rules in
mind with this. The downside is that we may make subtle changes to VM
code which the old binary won't detect and ignore. Maybe I could feature
it via flag or env var to prefer the userdata extensions. WDYT?

Well, not more than it has been: Take iptables-legacy for instance: An
old version may see a newer extension revision than it has support for,
so will fail just like iptables-nft with native code it can't parse. So
effectively iptables-nft becomes *as compatible as* the same version of
iptables-legacy.
Another perspective to this: Extension development gradually slows down
which we'll leverage while at the same time support increased
development in nftables itself and conversion of extensions to VM code.

Yes, among is not an issue because ebtables-nft never implemented this
as extension.

Well, we don't convert too many extensions to nftables anymore since
Florian reverted a bunch as a quick countermeasure against the compat
complaints. Things will certainly get worse, but the question is mostly
how many different extensions will "the largest rule" have. I added some
debug output and in shell testsuite for instance the largest compat_ext
userdata I see is 68 bytes. I was able to craft a rule which uses 159
bytes though:

iptables-nft -A FORWARD \
	-m limit --limit 1000/hour \
	-p udp -m udp --sport 1024:65535 --dport 4:65535 \
	-m mark --mark 0xfeedcafe/0xfeedcafe \
	-j NFLOG --nflog-group 23 \
	         --nflog-prefix "this is a damn long log prefix"

The current implementation calls xtables_error() if nftnl_udata_put()
fails. Maybe a better error path would be to only warn the user and not
add compat_ext to userdata. Guess it depends on whether this should be
enabled by default or only upon request - if user asks for compat_ext,
failing to do so should be fatal.

Cheers, Phil
