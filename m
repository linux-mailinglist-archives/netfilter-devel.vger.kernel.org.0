No, which is why I added that note below.  It shouldn't be hard to
change but I took the easy way to program it and now that I reflect on
it more, it sounds like it should be a basic requriement.

There was no 4th value, so the overlap is just the first three, which
are all table operations that more or less line up.

Again, I was a bit lazy in selecting the actions, and the GET actions
are of no interest since they don't change the configuration.

NEW and DEL of TABLEs, CHAINs and RULEs.

Well, we are only logging "some change", so is it necessary to log the
generation count to show that?  Is the generation count of specific
interest?

I did think of recording all failed attempts too, but coding that would
be more effort.  It is worth doing if it is deemed important,
particularly for permission issues (as opposed to resource limits or
packet format errors.  This would be more of interest to a security
officer rather than a network technician, but the latter may find it
useful for debugging.

Ah, ok, so yes, we would need that too.  I see family and table in
there, op is evident.  Is there a useful value we can use in the
"entries" field?

I was aiming for a relevant value such as perhaps the new rule number or
the rule number being deleted.

Can you suggest something meaningful?  This field may need to get
different information for each operation.

I don't think we need to be able to completely reconstruct the
tables/chains/rules from the information in the audit log, but be aware
of who is changing what when.

I do think it is interesting.

So rule number would be a useful differentiator here.

As a first pass, simply booting a test system and running the
audit-testsuite has provided some useful fodder.

Florian, thanks for your review and input.
