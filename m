Getting back to this dusty topic again: I played with extending
'identifier' in parser_bison.c like so:

| @@ -2183,6 +2183,7 @@ chain_policy              :       ACCEPT          { $$ = NF_ACCEPT; }
|                         ;
|  
|  identifier             :       STRING
| +                       |       HOUR            { $$ = strdup("hour"); }
|                         ;
|  
|  string                 :       STRING

I am able to create a table named 'hour'. The approach has two problems
though AFAICT:

1) When adding TABLE as identifier, bison spews shift/reduce conflict
   warnings.

2) In order to allow for really arbitrary names, we would have to add
   all defined keywords to identifier. This is tedious, ugly and (most
   importantly) a moving target.

Do you think it is possible to address these problems?

Cheers, Phil
