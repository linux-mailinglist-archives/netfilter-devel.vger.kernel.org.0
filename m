... which (BATCH_DONE reached) would be made moot by this proposed
patch, as we would ACK it even if its not reached anymore.

Right, 1:1 relationship between messages and ACKs is only there for
theoretical infinite receive buffer which makes this feature rather limited
for batched case.

OK, from what I gather you'd like for
"netfilter: nfnetlink: always ACK batch end if requested"
to not be applied.

I would still like to apply the nfnetlink selftest however (even
if it has to be trimmed/modified), because it does catch the issue
fixed by Fernando
 [ 09efbac953f6 ("netfilter: nfnetlink: reset nlh pointer during batch replay") ]:

ok 1 nfnetlink_batch.simple_batch
#  RUN           nfnetlink_batch.module_load ...
# nfnetlink.c:239:module_load:[seq=1759907514] ACK
# nfnetlink.c:239:module_load:[seq=1759907512] ACK
# nfnetlink.c:244:module_load:Out of order ack: seq 1759907512 after 1759907514
# nfnetlink.c:239:module_load:[seq=1759907513] ACK
# nfnetlink.c:239:module_load:[seq=1759907514] ACK
# nfnetlink.c:239:module_load:[seq=1759907515] ACK
# nfnetlink.c:254:module_load:Expected 0 (0) == out_of_order (1)
# module_load: Test terminated by assertion
#          FAIL  nfnetlink_batch.module_load

If the decision is that there should NOT be an ACK for the BATCH_END if
there was an error, then the test only needs minor adjustment:

-       // Expect 5 acks: batch_begin, table, invalid_table(error), chain, batch_end
-       validate_res(self->nl, seq - 5, 5, _metadata);
+       // Expect 4 acks: batch_begin, table, invalid_table(error), chain
+       validate_res(self->nl, seq - 4, 4, _metadata);

So, what is the 'more useful' behaviour?  Choices are all equally bad:

1. If we want to always include it, it might not be there due to
   -ENOBUFS, which will always happen if the batch was large (triggers
   too many acks).
2. If we only include it on success, it might not be there for the
   same reason, so absence doesn't imply failure.

HOWEVER, if the batch was small enough then 2) gives slightly more
useable feedback in the sense that the entire batch was processed.

So I am leaning towards not applying the nfnetlink patch but applying
the (adjusted) test case.

Other takes?
