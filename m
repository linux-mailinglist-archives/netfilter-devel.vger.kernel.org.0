I did not mean to say that, no, I mostly wanted to spell out the scenario t=
o
make sure we are on the same page about the goal.

I have tried it out with a kernel that had V2 of the "socket type" patch se=
t
patched in, with the minor fix that we discussed on the "socket type" patch
thread after the initial submission.  On that kernel, I did not have the
patch-fix applied.

The patch-fix should keep the listen() from working, yes, but I have not tr=
ied
it out yet.

I do not think that restricting auto-binding for connect as part of
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP would be the correct way.

I believe you did; After reading a lot of documentation on that subject
recently, let me try to phrase it in yet another way, so that we are on the=
 same
page:

The socket operations do the following things:

 - listen() and connect() make the local port available from the outside.

 - bind(): Userspace processes call bind() to express that they want to use=
 a
   specific local address (IP+port) with the given socket.  With TCP, users=
pace
   may always omit the call to bind().  If omitted, the kernel picks an
   ephemeral port.

So, bind() behaves the same way, whether is is being used with listen() or
connect().  The common way is to use listen() with bind() and connect() wit=
hout
bind(), but the opposite can also be done: listen() without bind() will lis=
ten
on an ephemeral port, and connect() with bind() will use the desired port.

(The Unix Network Programming book remarks that listen() without bind() is =
done
for SunRPC servers, where the separately running portmapper daemon provides=
 a
lookup facility for the running services, and services can therefore be off=
ered
on any port.)

A good description I found in the man pages is this:

From ip(7):

  An ephemeral port is allocated to a socket in the following circumstances=
:

  =E2=80=A2  the port number in a socket address is specified as 0 when cal=
ling bind(2);
  =E2=80=A2  listen(2) is called on a stream socket that was not previously=
 bound;
  =E2=80=A2  connect(2) was called on a socket that was not previously boun=
d;
  =E2=80=A2  sendto(2) is called on a datagram socket that was not previous=
ly bound.

(This section of the ip(7) man page is referenced from connect(2) and liste=
n(2),
in their ERRORS sections.)

So, due to the symmetry of how bind() behaves for both connect() and listen=
(),
my suggestion would be:

 * Keep the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP implementation as it is.

 * Clarify in LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP that this only makes calls to bi=
nd()
   return errors, but that this does not keep a socket from listening on
   ephemeral ports.

 * Create a new LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_LISTEN_TCP access right and restrict
   listen() with that.  Looking at your patch set again, the code in
   hook_socket_listen() should be very similar, but we might want to call
   check_access_socket() with the port number that was previously bound (if
   bind() was called).

Does that sound reasonable?


With the current patch-fix as you sent it on the top of this thread, there =
are
otherwise some confusing aspects to it, such as:

 * connect() is also implicitly using a local ephemeral port, just like
   listen().  But while calls to listen() are checked against
   LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP, calls to connect() are not.

 * listen() can return an error due to LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP,
   even when the userspace program never called bind().

Both of these are potentially puzzling and might be more in-line with BSD s=
ocket
concepts if we did it differently.

You are right -- my fault, I misread that.
