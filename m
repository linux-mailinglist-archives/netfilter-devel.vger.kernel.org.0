The Fixes: tag will suffice for -stable, correct?

I don't see why we have to hold back user space. There was no support
for these wildcards in nft tool yet, so probably nothing relies upon the
old (i.e., non-NUL-terminated strings in NFTA_DEVICE_NAME) behaviour
yet. Even if something does, the kernel (with my patch applied) will
treat it sanely as non-wildcard.

Updated user space facing a kernel prior to my patch will detect lack of
wildcard support, even if the kernel would support it (via
non-NUL-terminated string in NFTA_DEVICE_NAME).

Am I missing your point?

With NFTA_DEVICE_PREFIX, old user space will stop parsing the netlink
message (nftnl_{chain,flowtable}_nlmsg_parse() will return -1). Given
the limited control, this is almost ideal behaviour.

I sent an RFC implementing Florian's suggested solution to detect
potential problems a few months ago but didn't get a reply:

Subject: [nft RFC] table: Embed creating nft version into userdata
Message-ID: <20250512210321.29032-1-phil@nwl.cc>

Maybe putting "PATCH" in the prefix would have provoked feedback? :D
Could you please have a look? I think it is quite unintrusive and
probably the most reliable way of letting users know something may be
odd in the output they're seeing.

This may work for error reporting/debug output in libnftnl, but I doubt
exposing the opaque data in nft output to make it survive a
save'n'restore is doable.

Maybe we could add versions to netlink messages so user space knows if
it will understand all content or not. This could even allow users to
specify a max version to use on command line and nft would reject any
input requiring a larger version. Of course this means tracking "version
requirements" of expressions and other features.

Cheers, Phil
