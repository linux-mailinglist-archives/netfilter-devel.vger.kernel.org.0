We can indead add a virtual any/wildcard type and protocol, translated
from user space's (i64)-1 .  The downside is that for the same domain
layer we would need to check 4 different keys for the same triplet (i.e.
famility is always set, but type and protocol are optionals).  With the
socket_layers number, we only have to check for one key per domain
layer.  However, in the worse case with at least 3 domain layers having
different socket_layers value, we would still need to check for 3
different keys.  So, I think it's reasonable to get rid of the
socket_layers as you suggested (while requiring the family to always be
set).
