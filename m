I think such comment is not required if we remove
"current_check_access_socket()" as you suggest? In this function
access_request can be a mask with multiple access rights included.

Good idea! But I suggest using "get_port_from_addr_tcp()" naming to
distinguish between extracting a port from an address structure and
from a socket (as performed in hook_listen() in the next patch).
