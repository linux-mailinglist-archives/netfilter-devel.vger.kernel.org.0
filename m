 automatic merge of adjacent/overlapping set elements (only for interval sets) |
 |=================
 
+The *gc-interval* doesn't affect element timeout, but it does affect memory reclaim.
+A large set that rarely has elements that time out can use a higher (less frequent) garbage
+collection to save cpu time, whereas sets that see many updates with short-lived elements
+will benefit from a lower interval.
+Lower intervals ensure the set stays below its maximum size.
+Internally, a timed-out entry stays around until it is removed by the garbage collector, which
+also decrements the sets element count.
+This also means that it is possible to have a set that can not accept more elements, even
+if all elements timed out, if the *gc-interval* is set too large.
+
+The *size* defines the upper limit of the amount of elements that the set can support.
+Mandatory for sets that are added to from the ruleset with the *add* and *update* keywords.
+Providing the *size* keyword for sets that are only added to via *nft add element* allows for
+a more compact (memory conserving) set implementation selection, but it is not required.
+
+The optional *policy* keyword can be used to request a more memory-conserving set implementation.
+
+*auto-merge* instructs the nftables frontend to merge adjacent and overlapping ranges.
+Example: When the set contains range *1.2.3.1-1.2.3.4*, then adding element *1.2.3.2* has no
+effect.  Adding *1.2.3.5* changes the existing range to cover *1.2.3.1-1.2.3.5*.
+Without this flag, *1.2.3.2* can not be added and *1.2.3.5* is inserted as a new entry.
