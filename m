I was referring to the iptables rule command. Not sure it's worth
there the alias. I think you mentioned that there's already -0 and -1
in the rule command line, hence the -0 and -1 for xtables-monitor.

I think we would need a common parser, and that's not feasible. Unless
there is some preparsing, just to check if the family option is in
place, ie. -4, -6, --arp and --bridge, then route the parsing to the
corresponding parser. It's a bit of extra glue code, not sure it's
worth, just an idea / future work if helping all these tooling
converge might be of interest.

Noted. I have seen the recent patch to fix this.
