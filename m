It's not OK that the bridge uses dev_queue_xmit().

That was an ugly solution to make the REJECT target work from
br_netfilter, because there was absolutely no other better way at that
time to make it work.

There has been now native support to reject traffic from the bridge
from many years on through br_forward(), which is the way to go.

If you want to reject from a non-bridge setup, there is also ingress
support where you can reject exactly in the way you want, way earlier
than from prerouting.
