RTSP does not seem that complex to me. It is a bit like FTP: the
client sends a first connection in order to define the ports to use,
then the server initiates the connection on those ports.
I saw some examples of RTSP helper libraries written for old versions
of the kernel (focused on iptables), so I think it would not be very
complicated to port to newest versions.

It would mean we would need to open/expect a very wide range of ports,
if we don't look into the first message to grab the real used port=E2=80=A6

By the way, as I had no feedback for the moment regarding expectation
patch I sent (yes, I know it needs time to code review), I just
wondered if I sent them correctly and if they arrived to the mailing
list. They are 4 mails sent on May 17th at about 18:40 CEST. If
someone could just confirm reception, that would be good.

Thank you
