Yes, it is a rather sloppy solution. I could at least do a shortest
substring first search in addition to check if the input is ambiguous.

Guess if someone is able to manipulate /etc/services, any service names
are problematic, not just in ranges.

Another potential problem I didn't have in mind though is that 'a-b'
could mean [a; b] or [a-b] assuming that all three exist. But I haven't
found a valid example in my /etc/services, yet. :)

Well, we could allow both (a-b with numeric a and b only) and use it in
output only if non-numeric was requested.

Maybe also just limit service names in DNAT to non-ranges. I wanted to
write "like with REDIRECT before the merge", but it looks like it
accepted them as upper boundary, e.g. '10-ftp-data'.

Hmm. I also noticed my series drops support for port 0 from REDIRECT
which commit 84d758b3bc312 ("extensions: REDIRECT: fix --to-ports
parser") explicitly allowed.

Thanks, Phil
