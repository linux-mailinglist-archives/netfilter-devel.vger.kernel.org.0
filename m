True, which is why we all end up with long lists of issues/patches at
the moment.  The initial reaction is "we need a dashboard for everyone
to collab around!" like you did here, but I'd like to say this is not
the best thing to do at all.

syzbot can get away with a dashboard because someone is tending to it,
triaging the "serious" bugs before they become public, and only letting
the "would be nice to fix one day" type issues remain.  That's a huge
resource commitment that Google has made here, and that's great, but I
doubt that anyone else will have those resources to do this type of
thing.

Instead, let's just work to get these things fixed.  We all have
hundreds of patches/reports in our internal systems right now,
attempting to triage/rank/coordinate would just waste time.  In other
words, just grind through them, send patches out, and get these fixed.

I'm doing this now, and I know many others are as well.  We are all
running "different" tools, and so we find different issues, so we can
all just keep sending patches as we get them done.  It's going to take a
lot of effort (I've somehow convinced 8 interns to help me out with this
this summer), but once we get it done, we'll be much better off.

That's great, keep it up!

Again, I think that effort is going to be larger than just getting the
patches fixed and pushed out.  It also turns into a central
point-of-failure, which is what we do not want to have at all for the
kernel.

But hey, I could be totally wrong.  Maybe some generous company that is
involved in unleashing this hell on us would be so kind as to pony up to
do the work to create this and help fix the issues that their tools are
finding.  Just like Google did in the past, there is precedent, but for
some reason people don't like learning from history...

It's going to be a long 18 months...
