We should not be adding syscall records to anything that does not result fr=
om=20
a syscall rule triggering the event. Its very wasteful. More wasteful than=
=20
just adding the necessary fields.

I also wished we had a coding specification that put this in writing so tha=
t=20
every event is not a committee decision. That anyone can look at the docume=
nt=20
and Do The Right Thing =E2=84=A2.

If I add a section to Writing-Good-Events outlining the expected ordering o=
f=20
fields, would that be enough that we do not have long discussions about eve=
nt=20
format? I'm thinking this would also help new people that want to contribut=
e.
