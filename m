I agree with Florian and you that removing toggles is a good idea, but
this one is useful for me at this stage, we revisit later on. There is
a specific tests infra for the monitor mode but it is rather limited.
I can also crash nft monitor with a few scenarios I am looking at to
fix it. Maybe -U can go away in the near future and monitor tests can
get better coverage.
