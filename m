If you don't specify the verdict attribute, then kernel says -EINVAL.
For reference, the function to handle the netlink message that comes
from userspace is nfqnl_recv_verdict() [1].

The nfqueue netlink protocol forces the user to send the verdict along
with the packet contents (only relevent if the contents have been
updated, if packet is left untouched, you can skip sending the packets
contents so the kernel assumes packet is not altered).

Setting verbosity mode on here, many of this information you might
already know, but I prefer this for clarity.

Thanks.
