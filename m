Actually this seems to work:

table inet filter {
         set cg {
                 typeof socket cgroupv2 level 0
         }

         chain y {
                 socket cgroupv2 level 2 @cg accept
		counter drop
         }
}

Simulating systemd adding the cgroup of a service to the set:
# nft add element inet filter cg "system.slice/systemd-resolved.service"

Cgroup ID (inode number of the cgroup) has been successfully added:
# nft list set inet filter cg
         set cg {
                 typeof socket cgroupv2 level 0
                 elements = { 6032 }
         }
# ls -id /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/systemd-resolved.service
6032 /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/systemd-resolved.service/
