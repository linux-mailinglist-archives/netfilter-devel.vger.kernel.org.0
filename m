Ah, thanks for the pointer. That function (and the code therein) pretty
clearly shows why rule-shredding is so much slower in iptables-nft than
legacy despite the attempts at improving it.

I appreciate the effort to identify a solution which "just works",
though am not sure if we really should implement such hacks (yet). That
said, the "fast" expressions strictly speaking are hacks as well ...
