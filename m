This buffer is still relatively small, the reallocation also forces
the user to refetch pointers. Skipping all that complexity for a bit
of memory in userspace is fine.

I'd suggest to add the NFQ_ prefix, probably NFQ_BUFFER_SIZE is fine.

I'm fine to expose if you would like to add pktb_head_size() if you
prefer to store the pkt_buff in the stack. You will have to use
pktb_build_data() [1] to initialize the pkt_buff. Would that work for you?
