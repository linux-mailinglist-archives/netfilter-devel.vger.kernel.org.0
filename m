After reboot, "/var/run/netns" does not exist before we run the first
`ip netns add` command. Previously, "test-wrapper.sh" would mount a
tmpfs on that directory, but that fails, if the directory doesn't exist.
You will notice this, by deleting /var/run/netns (which only root can
delete or create, and which is wiped on reboot).

Instead, mount all of "/var/run". Then we can also create /var/run/netns
directory.

This means, any other content from /var/run is hidden too. That's
probably desirable, because it means we don't depend on stuff that
happens to be there. If we would require other content in /var/run, then
the test runner needs to be aware of the requirement and ensure it's
present. But best is just to not require anything. It's only iproute2
which insists on /var/run/netns.
