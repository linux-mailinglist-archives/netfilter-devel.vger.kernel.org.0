Yes, -X fails if the chain has rules.

Yes.

Yes, assuminy you meant -X instead of -D.

This behaves just like before, it deletes all rules (-F) and all user-defined
chains (-X).

ATM iptables -X $BUILTIN will always fail.
In -legecy there is no kernel API to allow for its removal,
for -nft there is an extra check that throws an error.

> Or am I missing anything else?

No, I don't think so.  I would prefer if
iptables-nft -F -t filter
iptables-nft -X -t filter

... would result in an empty "filter" table.

I could also add a patch that requests removal
of the table as well for the -X case; but unlike base chain the
presence of the table alone has no impact on dataplane.
