I agree with Eric.  There is nothing special in xtables compared to
kvmalloc usage elsewhere in the stack.  Why "fix" xtables and not e.g.
rhashtable?

Please work with mm hackers to improve the situation for your use case.

Maybe its enough to raise __GFP_NORETRY in kmalloc_gfp_adjust() if size
results in >= PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER allocation.

How can that work?  kvmalloc won't make vmalloc backed memory
physically contiguous.
