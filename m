Updates on the copy could be done without using the deactivate/active
logic since it is not exposed to the packet path. Then, you use the
copy (next generation of the datastructure) to check for overlaps? We
need keep pointer to two sets in the rbtree private data area, the
generation ID would point to the current set that is being used from
the packet path. The stale tree is released from the commit phase (see
below).

If your idea is still in planning phase, could you summarize again the
idea? You mentioned about using gc you mentioned, if it is more simple
than my proposal, then it should be good to go too.

It should be possible to add a ->commit operation to set->ops, then
call it at the end of the commit phase, ie. iterate over the list of
existing sets in the table and call set->ops->commit().

Makes sense, thanks for explaining.
