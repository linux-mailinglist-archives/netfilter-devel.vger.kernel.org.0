Thanks!

Eric plans to push zones individually into the kernel from firewalld so
the problem shouldn't occur anymore unless one uses a ridiculously large
zone.

The socket doesn't live long enough to monitor it this way, but I tested
at which point things start failing again:

In firewalld, I see startup errors when having more than eight zones
configured. This is not too much, but given that we're talking about a
restrictive environment and the above change is planned anyway, it's not
a real problem.

The simple reproducer script I pasted earlier fails if the number of
rules exceeds 382. The error message is:

| netlink: Error: Could not process rule: Message too long

So I assume it is simply exhausting netlink send buffer space.

BTW: Outside of lxc, my script still succeeds for 100k rules and 1M
rules triggers OOM killer. :)

Cheers, Phil
