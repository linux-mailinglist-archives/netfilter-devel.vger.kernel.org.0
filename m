We have kselftests, but nftables/tests/shell probe for kernel
capabilities then it runs tests according to what the kernel
supports, this includes packet and control plane path tests. For
iptables, there are iptables-tests.py for the control plane path.

I don't think so, iptables-nft supports the same features as
iptables-legacy.
