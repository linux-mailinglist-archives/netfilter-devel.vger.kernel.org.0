OK, for fun I tried compiling with linux headers from 2.6.39 and 3.0.101
in /usr/include/linux. The only missing files apart from the above were
linux/bpf{,_common}.h. So I guess if we add those as well, we're good
for a while. :)

Git says, it's my fault. :(
When merging libipt and libip6t LOG.c files, I introduced the include
but missed to copy the header as well.

I'll apply Thomas' patch adding a reference to my commit and follow up
with bpf header copy (unless someone objects).

Thanks, Phil
