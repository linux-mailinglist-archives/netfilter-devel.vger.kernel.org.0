I'm fine with them.  Do you want me to resend them as patches
(instead of as attachments)?

When running tests I noted an oddity:

tests/shell/testcases/0031set_timeout_size_0 fails because
1d2h3m4s10ms is reported as 1d2h3m4s8ms, so 2 msec less.
Might be caused by the kernel I tested against (v5.13.12),
doesn't seem related to my patches, but odd nevertheless.

Thanks,

Lukas
