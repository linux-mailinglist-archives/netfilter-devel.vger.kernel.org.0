This is expected behaviour. The xfrm interfaces are plaintext devices,
the plaintext packets are routed to the xfrm interface which guarantees
transformation. So the lookup that assigns skb_dst(skb)->xfrm
happens 'behind' the interface. After transformation,
skb_dst(skb)->xfrm will be cleared. So this assignment exists just
inside xfrm in that case.

Does netfilter match against skb_dst(skb)->xfrm? What is the exact case
that does not work?
