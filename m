If I understand the code right, line 700 is a duplicate of line 698, 701
of 699 and 704 of 702. This is because 'W*' parses identical to 'W0' and
in right-hand side only the first three text fields (genre, version and
subtype) are relevant - the rest is ignored.

When adding, this doesn't become visible because flag NLM_F_EXCL is not
specified. If it is, kernel returns EEXISTS for those lines.

Cheers, Phil
