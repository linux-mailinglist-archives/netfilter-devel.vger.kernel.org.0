Hmm, why?  Can't the variable offset be stored in the map itself
(instead of the new dport value)?

so assuming a map that has

  typeof ip saddr . ip daddr : ip daddr . tcp dport

... but the map content stores the delta to use, e.g.

  { 192.168.7.1 . 10.2.2.2 : 10.2.2.1 . 10000 }

... where 10000 isn't the new dport but a delta that has to be added.

  [ payload load 4b @ network header + 12 => reg 1 ] # saddr
  [ payload load 4b @ network header + 16 => reg 9 ] # daddr
  [ lookup reg 1 set m dreg 1 0x0 ]	# now we have reg1: dnat addr, reg 9: delta to add
  [ payload load 2b @ transport header + 2 => reg 10 ]
  [ math add reg 9 + reg 10 => reg 9 ]		# real port value from packet added with delta
  [ nat dnat ip addr_min reg 1 addr_max reg 1 proto_min reg 9 proto_max reg 9 flags 0x3 ]

add operation should probably also take a modulus (fixed immediate value)
so we can make a defined result for things like:

  65532 + 10000

... without a need to wrap implicitly back to "0 + remainder".

Yep, understood.  This is mapping the existing iptables approach,
but using register instead of immediate to pass data.

Its not needed for concatentation case, the port value (in packet)
is always a fixed value, so it can be (re)loaded at runtime.

But maybe i'm missing something that the nat engone is already offering
 that this approach can't handle, or some other limitation.
