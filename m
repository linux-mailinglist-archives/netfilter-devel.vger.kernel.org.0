Thanks for this initial implementation, I think it's a good start and I
would like to complete it. Currently I'm running into roadblocks with
anonymous sets, though (I didn't even test named ones yet). The
anonymous ones are what I hit first when trying to fix tests/py/ payload
files.

The simple example is:
| nft --debug=netlink add rule ip t c ip saddr { 10.0.0.1, 1.2.3.4 }

I tried to extract NFTNL_UDATA_SET_KEYBYTEORDER and
NFTNL_UDATA_SET_DATABYTEORDER from set's udata in
nftnl_set_snprintf_default() but those are not present. Also set's
'key_type' and 'data_type' fields are zero, probably because the set
doesn't have a formal definition.

I added some debug printing to nftnl_rule_snprintf_default() and
apparently debug output prints the set content before it is called,
therefore I can't use your infrastructure to deduce the set elements'
byteorder from the lookup expression's sreg.

Any ideas how this could be solved?

Thanks, Phil
