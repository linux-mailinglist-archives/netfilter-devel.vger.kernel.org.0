So what you are saying is you want all the fields that are being
proposed to be added to this record?

If the records are all from one event, they all should all have the same
timestamp/serial number so that the records are kept together and not
mistaken for multiple events.  One reason for having information in
seperate records is to be able to filter them either in kernel or in
userspace if you don't need certain records.

If you add this expected ordering of fields, can we re-factor all the
kernel code to use this order because the userspace parser won't care
what order they are in?

I realize this isn't what you are saying, but having a clear description
in that document that talks about the different classes of events and
what each one needs in terms of minimum to full subject attributes and
object attributes would help a lot.  It would also help for new records
to be able to decide if it should follow the format of an existing
related or similar record, or a new class with the expected standard orde=
r.
