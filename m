Yes, with ipset you can avoid to increase the cost linearly with the number of
SIDs (at the prize of increased configuration complexity IMO, because the
network administrator should learn to use ipset).

Anyway, our concern is valid for the case in which you have only a single SID
and you are forced to add a single rule to explicitly allow that SID. In fact,
the measurement results we have discussed only consider one SID.

That seems to be a promising approach to be explored; I'm looking forward to
receiving more details on how you will design the packet processing paths for
the various scenarios considering these new hooks.

The problem is that the patch forces us to add an explicit accept rule when the
default policy is set to DROP. So, we are measuring the performance penalty for
an existing and typical scenario when filtering is a requirement.

We could also measure as you suggest the performance penalty due to the simple
addition of the hooks. This is an interesting test to be performed that we can
definitely consider. However this gives us the penalty for the "best case" not
even for the "average" one.

You are right.
Sorry for not having included details about the test earlier.
Please see below, thanks.

Details on Testbed and measurements
===================================

We set up a testbed using the SRPerf framework as discussed in [1]. 
Figure 1 depicts the testbed architecture that we used: it comprises two nodes
denoted as Traffic Generator and Receiver (TGR) and System Under Test (SUT)
respectively.

+--------------+                           +--------------+

Figure 1: Testbed architecture

The packets are generated by the TGR on the Sender port, enter the SUT from the
IN port, exit the SUT from the OUT port and then they are received back by the
TGR on the Receiver port.

SRPerf measures the maximum throughput, defined as the maximum packet rate in
Packet Per Seconds (pps) for which the packet drop ratio is smaller than or
equal to a given threshold (in our case we chose 0.5%). This is also referred
to as Partial Drop Rate (PDR) at a 0.5% drop ratio (in short PDR@0.5%). Further
details on PDR can be found in [1].

SRPerf uses the TRex [2] generator in order to evaluate the maximum throughput
that can be processed by the SUT Node. The source code of SRPerf is available
at [3].

The testbed is deployed on the CloudLab facilities [4], a flexible
infrastructure dedicated to scientific research on the future of Cloud
Computing. Both the TGR and the SUT are two identical bare metal servers whose
hardware characteristics are shown below:

-----------------------------------------------------------
 CPU:   2x Intel E5-2630 (8 Core 16 Thread) at 2.40 GHz
 RAM:   128 GB of ECC RAM
 Disks: 2x 1.2 TB HDD SAS 6Gbps 10K rpm
        1x 480 GB SSD SAS 6Gbps
 NICs:  Intel Corporation 82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP
        Intel I350 1Gb Dual Port
-----------------------------------------------------------

Each bare metal server uses the two Intel 82599ES 10-Gigabit network interface
cards to provide back-to-back connectivity between testbed nodes like described
in Figure 1.

On the SUT Node we deploy and execute experiments for studying the proposed
scenarios.
Here we run:
  i) a vanilla Linux kernel 5.13.0, for scenarios 1.a and 2.a;
 ii) the same kernel release of (i) with the patch under discussion
     applied to, for scenarios 1.b and 2.b.

In any case, the SUT Node is configured as an SRv6 Node in an SRv6 Network.


SUT Node and experiment parameters
==================================

On the SUT Node we compiled both the vanilla kernel 5.13.0 and the patched
kernel 5.13.0 using the same config file. In particular, we enabled the
SR-related options as well as the Netfilter support. 

We disabled GRO, GSO and the hardware transmitting and receiving offloading
capabilities on the 82599ES 10-Gigabit network interfaces that are used to
connect the two testbed servers. We changed the IRQ settings so that all the
queues of the 10-Gigabit NICs were served by a single CPU and Hyper-Threading
was disabled. 


Scenarios 1.a, 2.a (SRv6 End behavior)
-------------------------------------

Two experiments have been carried out respectively for scenario 1.a and 2.a.
Either way, they both make use of the same SUT configuration and process the
same kind of traffic generated by the TGR.

TGR generates IPv6+SRH traffic which is sent directly to the SUT IN port. Every
single packet sent by the TGR is has the same format:


+-----------+------------+-----+------------+-----+-----------+
|           |            |     |            |     |           |
| MAC Layer | IPv6 Outer | SRH | IPv6 Inner | UDP | Raw bytes |
|           |            |     |            |     |           |
+-----------+------------+-----+------------+-----+-----------+

/-------------------------- 162 bytes ------------------------/

Where:
 - IPv6 Outer SA: 1:2:1::1, DA: f1::
 - SRH SID List: f1::,f2::
 - IPv6 Inner SA: 1:2:1::1, IPv6 DA: b::2 
 - UDP sport: 50701, dport: 5001 | Raw bytes (16 Bytes)

In the SUT Node, a single SRv6 End Behavior is set for the SID f1::

On SUT Node, incoming traffic at enp6s0f0 (IN port) matches the IPv6 DA with
the SID f1:: and the SRv6 End Behavior is executed. After that, processed
packets are then sent back to the TGR through the enp6s0f1 (OUT port).

Please note that SIDs f1:: and f2:: are *not* assigned to any interface of the
SUT.

The SUT Node is also configured with some firewall policies. The default rule
for IPv6 INPUT is set as DROP and an explicit ACCEPT rule for SID f1:: is also
configured.


Scenarios 1.b, 2.b (SRv6 T.Encap Behavior)
------------------------------------------

Two experiments have been carried out respectively for scenario 1.b and 2.b.
Either way, they both make use of the same SUT configuration and process the
same kind of traffic generated by the TGR.

TGR generates plain IPv6 traffic which is sent directly to the SUT IN port.
Every single packet sent by the TGR follows the same format:

+-----------+------------+-----+-----------+
|           |            |     |           |
| MAC Layer |    IPv6    | UDP | Raw bytes |
|           |            |     |           |
+-----------+------------+-----+-----------+

/----------------- 82 bytes ---------------/

Where:
 - IPv6 SA: 1:2:1::1, IPv6 DA: b::2 
 - UDP sport: 39892, dport: 5001 | Raw bytes (16 Bytes)


In the SUT Node, a single SRv6 T.Encap Behavior is set for the IPv6 DA b::2.

On SUT Node, incoming traffic at enp6s0f0 (IN port) matches the IPv6 DA with
b::2 and the SRv6 T.Encap Behavior is executed. Then, the whole
IPv6+SRH packet (SID List [f1::]) is sent back to the TGR through the
enp6s0f1 (OUT Port).

Please note that b::2 and SID f1:: are *not* assigned to any interface of the
SUT.

The SUT Node does not restrict the locally generated traffic.
The default OUTPUT policy for IPv6 is set to ACCEPT.
