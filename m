Or maybe I am not intelligent enough to read and comprehend the sorting
function. ;)

Meanwhile I managed to find a reproducer for covscan's complaint:

With a ruleset of:

| table ip t {
| 	set s {
| 		type inet_service
| 		flags interval
| 	}
| }

The following command segfaults:

| # nft add element t s '{ 10-40, 5-15 }'

According to gdb it happens the line above
'return expr_binary_error(...)' in ei_insert(), namely segtree.c:279. No
idea why it's in the wrong line, but it seems to be just the reported
issue as 'lei' is NULL.

Interestingly, adding a rule with an anonymous set and the same elements
works fine, no idea why.

What do you think, should I continue investigating or can we just go
with my original fix (for now at least)?

Cheers, Phil
