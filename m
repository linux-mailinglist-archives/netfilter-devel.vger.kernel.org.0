It sounded like a good idea and I actually started sketching it, but
there's one fundamental issue: it doesn't help with overlap detection
because we also want to check insertions that will be part of the live
copy. If, within one transaction, you delete and create elements, the
"dirty" copy is still dirty for the purposes of overlaps.

For the lookup, that might help. Is it worth it right now, though? At
the moment I would go back and try to get overlap detection work
properly, at least, with my previous idea.

Well, it keeps two copies already: all the insertions and removals are
done on the dirty copy. The two problems we have there are:

- the clean copy might also contain inactive elements (because on a
  "commit" operation the API doesn't guarantee that all inserted
  elements are active), so we need to check for those during lookup,
  which is quite heavy (in my tests that was 4% of the clock cycles
  needed for lookup in a set with 30 000 "port, protocol" entries)

- on every _activate() call, we also need to commit the dirty copy onto
  a clean one, instead of having one commit per transaction (because if
  there's a newly activated item, we need to see it from the lookup),
  so every transaction translates to a number of commit operations for
  the back-end.

  That also makes things a bit complicated and it might very well be
  related to point 3. below

...there's no actual workqueue: garbage collection (for timed out
entries) only happens on commit, I don't see a particular problem with
it.

I think both issues would be solved if we had a more natural API, that
is, having a single call to the back-end implementing a commit
operation, instead of separately activating single entries. I don't
know how complicated this change would be.

=46rom a set back-end perspective it looks trivial (pipapo would be
greatly simplified, hash would also need to keep two copies but we
would remove some complexity by getting rid of some checks).

Perhaps it would be good enough (minus points 1. and 3. here) to start
offering it as a default option (the change is trivial, setting
NFT_PIPAPO_MIN_FIELDS to 1) and see if regressions are reported (actually,
I doubt it).

Yes, I included it here because I wouldn't offer pipapo as rbtree
replacement as long as that issue is there.
