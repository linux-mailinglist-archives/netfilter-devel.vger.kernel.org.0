Ok, so it should not matter if it is before or after that
list_for_each_entry_safe(), which could be used to collect that summary.

The current fields are "table", "family", "entries", "op".

Could one batch change more than one table?  (I think it could?)

It appears it can change more than one family.
"family" is currently a single integer, so that might need to be changed
to a list, or something to indicate multi-family.

A batch can certainly change more than one chain, but that was already a
bonus.

"entries" would be the obvious place for the summary count.

Listing all the ops seems a bit onerous.  Is there a hierarchy to the
ops and if so, are they in that order in a batch or in nf_tables_commit()?
It seems I'd need to filter out the NFT_MSG_GET_* ops.
