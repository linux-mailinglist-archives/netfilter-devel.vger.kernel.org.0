Each recvmsg() call returns 32KB, grepping for NFT_MSG_NEWRULE returns
4290 lines.

To my surprise, the mnl_nft_rule_dump() code-path does not call
mnl_set_rcvbuffer(). Though explicitly calling it from nft_mnl_talk() passing
1<<24 as buffer size does not lead to different behaviour. I seem to recall the
32k was a kernel-side limit in netlink?

You're probably right, thanks for spending cycles on it.
