I'm saying that there might be scenarios where, once the xt
match/target is set up, we might call .xlate to print it not just once
(considering nft -i use case), but see below.

OK, you are refering to commands that do not need ruleset listing, in
that case setting up the xt match/target structure makes no sense.

Your original patch description says:

I agree, removing this extra clone is good.

I think this patch is fine, the caching of the xt match/target setup
should be easy to do, struct stmt is const on that path, but it could
be overrided in this case.
