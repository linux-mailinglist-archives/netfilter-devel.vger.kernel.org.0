Your /etc/services seems to be much larger than mine, many of those
don't exist in my case.

OK. My code preferred the latter, checking if the former is possible is
a poor workaround. The only difference it makes is rules get rejected
instead of changing behaviour silently.

That's an interesting point: "914c" is not usable in iptables. The code
tries strtoul which succeeds for "914", "c" is then rejected as illegal
remainder. To fix that, we had to consult getservbyname() first which is
a performance hit. Guess the whole "support users with bad number
memory" game is best effort, only.

I'll submit a v2 without the experimental "names in ranges" patch in a
minute.

Thanks, Phil
