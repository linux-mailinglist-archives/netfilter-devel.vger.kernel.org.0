LGTM.  I think your proposal to snapshot current time and
remove the "moving target" is key.

Right, I think that will work.
For rbtree, sync gc is kept in place, elements are not zapped,
they get tagged as DEAD, including the end element.

Then from commit, do full scan and remove any and all elements
that are flagged as DEAD or have expired.
