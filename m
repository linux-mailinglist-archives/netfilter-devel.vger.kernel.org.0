Okay, I see.

Yes, they are, but:

...even if we use those, we still need to call expr_evaluate_concat()
(with the same logic as implemented by set_evaluate()) to fill the
set->key fields in.

Conceptually, I think that set_evaluate() should apply just in the same
way no matter how sets are created, minus expression evaluation and
caching. Taking selecting bits out looks a bit fragile/inconsistent to
me. Maybe I'm biased by the fact it was relatively complicated for me
to narrow down this particular issue.
