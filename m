Right, it only happens if extra is specified.

+               memcpy(pkt_data, data, len);

+       } else {
+               pkt_data = data;
+       }

So buf is only used if extra is specified?

I agree that deferring the memcpy() and avoiding the malloc() is the
way to go, we only have to agree in the way to achieve this.

Regarding pktb_mangle() reallocation case, refetching the pointers
sounds fine, documenting this is sufficient.

I'm just hesitating about the new pktb_alloc2() approach because it
has many parameters, it's just looks a bit complicated to me (this
function takes 8 parameters).

If you can just pre-allocate the pkt_buff head from the configuration
phase (before receiving packets from the kernel), then attach the
buffer via pktb_setup_metadata() for each packet that is received (so
the pkt_buff head is recycled). With this approach, pktb_head_size()
won't be needed either.

My understanding is that requirements are:

* Users that do not want to mangle the packet, they use the buffer
  that was passed to recvmsg().
* Users that want to mangle the packet, they use the _mangle()
  function that might reallocate the data buffer (the one you would
  like to have). However, if this data buffer reallocation happens,
  then pkt_buff should annotate that this pkt_buff object needs to
  release this data buffer from pktb_free() otherwise.

That's fine, this is exactly how the kernel works: if the function
might reallocate the data area, then you have to refetch pointers
after this. If you teach _mangle() to do reallocations, then
documenting this is fine.

However, those reallocation need pktb_free() to release that new data
buffer, right?

> Still, I really like the deferred copy enhancement. Your thoughts?

The deferred copy idea when mangling sounds fine, we only have to
agree on how to get this done.

Thanks.
