Do you think we can fix this from the testsuite site? It would require
to replicate payload files. The snprintf printing is used for
debugging only at this stage. That would fix nft and this specific case.

Probably we can make assumptions based on context, such as payload
expression always express things in network byte order, and annotate
that such register stores something in network byteorder. For meta,
assume host byte order. Unless there is an explicit byteorder
expression.
