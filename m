Oh, yes of course. Existing iptables-nft-restore does:

1) delete table x if exists
2) add table x
3) add table x content

My idea is to:

+ 0) add table x
- 1) delete table x if exists
+ 1) delete table x
  2) add table x
  3) add table x content

Did you consider rule insert with index in your batch replay logic? I
did when duplicating it for nft, but decided it's not worth it and
people using 'add rule ... index IDX' have been warned already anyway.

My state from our last talk about it was "--noflush users are screwed
anyway". :)

The problem is that we can't unconditionally create NFT_MSG_NEWCHAIN
because that will reset the chain policy if non-default. So we need at
least a cache containing tables and chains, even for that simple rule
append command.
