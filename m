IIRC, rbtree insert path already performs gc on-demand.

Yes, this is lying to userspace to hide the implementation details.

I would really like to provide an alternative interface for the rbtree
to allow for the same netlink representation as pipapo. I expected
pipapo can replace rbtree by pipapo, but you mentioned in the past
this could be an issue.

OK, then we assume this will be forever used for debugging only,
unless rbtree is fully replaced.

Please, let me have a look, if I fail or it is too ugly you can still
ditch it and we can follow up with your approach.

Thanks.
