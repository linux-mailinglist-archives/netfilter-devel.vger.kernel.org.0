Then, probably a flag for this? Such flag would work like this?

- Allow for set element updates (from any process, no ownership).
- nft flush ruleset skips flushing the set.
- nft flush set x y flushes the content of this set.

The table owner would set on such flag.

Would this work for the scenario you describe below?

I'll have a look.

Default behaviour right now is: table is released if owner is gone.

It should be possible to add a flag to leave the ruleset in place
(owner flag would be cleared from NETLINK_RELEASE event path).
