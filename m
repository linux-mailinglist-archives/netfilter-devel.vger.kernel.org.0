OK, if my understanding is correct, these are the two options:

1) Infer from arguments the type of operation.
2) Have explicit NFT_BITWISE_{AND,OR,XOR} operations.

If so, I think it is better to stick to your original patch, where
explicit bitwise operations NFT_BITWISE_{_AND,_OR,_XOR} are added
(which is what you proposed last time IIRC).

Thanks for explaining.
