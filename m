I agree about that. We could check if the symbol type is SYMBOL_VALUE.
But I am not sure about where should we do it, maybe in the parser?

It happens later, right now if the given string does not point to an
existing chain it returns the usual error for this situation. e.g

define dest = randomchain

table ip foo {
	chain bar {
		jump $dest
	}

	chain ber {
	}
}

test_file.nft:7:3-12: Error: Could not process rule: No such file or
directory
		jump $dest
		^^^^^^^^^^
