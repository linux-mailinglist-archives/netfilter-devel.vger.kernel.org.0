Semantically speaking those lines are equivalent, it's just that input
and the output representation differ in some scenarios because the
decompilation routine differ in the way it builds the expressions.

BTW, why do you qualify this as a bug?

You mean, the user in that JSON script is comparing the input and
output strings to find the rule handle?

If so, we should explore a better way to do this, eg. expose some user
defined identifier in JSON that userspace sets on when sending the
batch to identify the object coming back from the kernel.

The existing approach ignores the kernel echo netlink message almost
entirely, it only takes the handle.

We need an unified way to deal with --json --echo, whether the input
is native nft or json syntax.

If the problem is described in the question I made above, how will
users passing native nft syntax and requesing json output will
identify the rule? They cannot make string matching comparison in that
case since there is no input JSON representation.

Thanks.
