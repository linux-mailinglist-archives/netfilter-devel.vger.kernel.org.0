Problem is that we do not keep any state.  Syncookes are restricted to 4
mss value:
static __u16 const msstab[] = {
 536,
1300,
1440,   /* 1440, 1452: PPPoE */
1460,
};

So, 1260 forces lowest value supported.

The table was based off a research paper that had mss distribution
tables.  Maybe more recent data is available and if things have changed
we could update the table accordingly.
