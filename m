libnfnetlink has good doxygen documentation but there was no output when
doxygen was run.

Patch 1/1 fixes that,
but on rebuilding there were a number warnings of the form:

right-hand operand of comma expression has no effect [-Wunused-value]

*This was not introduced by patch 1/1*

Instead, it is caused by the definition of "prefetch" in include/linux_list.h:

 #define prefetch(x) 1

the Linux kernel has:

 #define prefetch(x) __builtin_prefetch(x)

I see 3 ways to get back to a clean compile:

1. Suppress the warnings with a pragma

2. Reinstate the Linux definition of prefetch

3. Expunge prefetch from the header file

I have made all 3, please indicate which one you'd like.

1. & 2. are 1-liners while 3. is multiline.

3. allows of extra simplifications, such as defining a macro in a single
line or fewer lines than before. In some places I could also delete the fragment
"&& ({ 1;})".
