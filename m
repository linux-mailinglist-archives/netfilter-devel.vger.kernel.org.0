Adding existence checks where missing is indeed a good idea, but doesn't
quite solve the problem we're facing here. :)

My problem with these "sane defaults" is that we may cause inconsistent
behaviour in rulesets: In prerouting, 'meta oifgroup 0' will match no
matter which interface the packet will be routed to. Yes, prerouting
implies there is no output interface (yet), but I consider this an
implementation detail and there will likely be cases where it is not as
easy to spot why something can't work.

Cheers, Phil
