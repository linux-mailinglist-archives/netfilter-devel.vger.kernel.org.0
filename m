This is feasible. I could probably add a flags field instead of simple
boolean to the API so it is possible to specify an option such as:

        # nft -o offline -f ruleset.nft

which would print the ruleset listing without loading it.

This requires another step to group rules with the same statements
whenever possible, such routine would need to make sure that the rule
verdict is the same and that no stateful statements (eg. limit) is
used.

or even this:

* ip daddr . tcp dport { 1.1.1.1 . 0-65535, 2.2.2.2 . 0-65535, 0.0.0.0/0 . 80 } counter accept

but this requires a Linux kernel >= 5.6.

There are a few more transformations that come to my mind, such as
packing several snat/dnat rules into a map.

I'll be posting v2 of this patchset with many fixes and tests soon.
