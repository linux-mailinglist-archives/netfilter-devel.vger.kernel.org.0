But I wanted to see his production :(

I can't think of an easy way to remove that sleep(1), I could decrease
the timeouts passed to nft but then there's no portable way to wait for
less than one second.

Probably a good way to make it faster and still retain coverage would
be to decrease the amount of combinations. Right now, most of the 6 ^ 3
combinations (six "types", three values each to have: single, prefix,
range -- where allowed) are tested. I could stop after the first 3 x 3
matrix instead, if we come from run-tests.sh.

Let me know if you have other ideas, otherwise I'd send a patch doing
this.
