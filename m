OK.

> 3. once offload has happened, entire inet:forward may be bypassed

By bypassed, do you mean that chain forward ruleset body becomes
irrelevant? If the unfortunate answer is yes, than as in the original
report, once we are in the software fast path we do not do dscp
modification, right?

Then once we hit the NF_FLOW_TIMEOUT, some of the packets will have dscp
modified, because we've went out of software acceleration. I.e. some of
the packets will arrive with and some without dscp. As you can imagine,
this could be hard to debug. This is the scenario that the patch series
tries to fix.

Should we require our user to understand that some lines in their
forward table configuration may or may not be executed sporadically?
Should we give the user at least some kind of warning regarding this
during the ruleset load?

To be constructive, isn't it better to rephrase points 3 and 4 as:

3. once offload has happened, entire inet:forward will be executed with
the same semantics but with better performance. Any difference between
fast and slow path is considered a bug.

4. If something in user ruleset (such as dscp rule now) precludes fast
path optimization then either error will be given or slow path will be
taken with a warning.

As I've mentioned in my other reply to Pablo, our focus is exclusively
on the *software* fast path of the forward chain. In this scenario
getting into additional nftables VM path in the ingress or egress seems
like pessimization which we'd like to avoid.

Your critique of my offload flag is well deserved and fully correct,
thanks! The reason for the dscp statement offload flag was to try to be
explicit about the need for payload modification capture.

What we've really wanted to do here is to make the payload capture
dependent on the chain flowtable acceleration status. I.e. if the
forward chain is supposed to be accelerated, than the payload
modification capture should happen. Being lazy, I've went through that
ugly keyword path. Apologies for that.

Yes. But again hardware offload is irrelevant for the problem we have
here.

Frontend syntax and nft userspace should not be affected once we drop
the unneeded offload flag on dscp statement.

IMHO, the flowtable concept means transparent acceleration of packet
processing between the specified interfaces. If something in the ruleset
precludes such acceleration warnings/errors should be given.

Do you agree?

Once the goal of significant performance gains is preserved, the
expansion of the universe of accelerated expressions is benign. And why
not? We are still being fast.

My suggestion regarding doing the software fast path through the
flow_block tries to decouple the performance of the fast path from the
size of such universe. The basic idea is that you don't pay for what you
don't use.

Because it can be made faster :)
