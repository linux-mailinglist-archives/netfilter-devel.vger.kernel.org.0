Well, the '-1' certainly was! :D
In ss tool, '-0' is used to select packet sockets. Maybe that's where it
came from.

That's correct. So I guess changing cmdline flags to -a/-b makes sense
either way.

I would omit the prefix from output if a family was selected. For
unfiltered xtables-monitor output, I would change the prefix to
something more readable, e.g.:

'ip:  ',
'ip6: ',
'arp: ',
'eb:  '

What do you think?

Thanks for the input,
Phil
