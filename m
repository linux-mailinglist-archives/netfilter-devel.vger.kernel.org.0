Just to make sure this bug is not caused by something else.

Could you cherry-pick this kernel patch? It is currently missing 6.1.38:

commit 3e70489721b6c870252c9082c496703677240f53
Author: Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>
Date:   Mon Jun 26 00:42:18 2023 +0200

    netfilter: nf_tables: unbind non-anonymous set if rule construction fails
    
    Otherwise a dangling reference to a rule object that is gone remains
    in the set binding list.

I have requested included to -stable already.

Thanks.
