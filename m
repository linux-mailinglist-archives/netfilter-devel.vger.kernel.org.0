Hi Phil, Florian,

@Florian, could you push out what you have to flush your queue in this front?

I like this suggestion.

I think it should be possible to incrementally extend with these
suggestions, it should be possible to submit patches for your review.

I think allowing 'device foo' without family would be good.

inet is an "alias". I think dumpg both ip+ip6 hooks should be fine.

Yes, this all is more complicated and it needs a whole lot of work to
add this feature in a complete way, which makes sense to schedule this
for the _future_.
