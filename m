You hit the bull's eye: I have a ticket about this behaviour already,
claiming that having a non-trivial default value and omitting it from
output is not a good idea. In practice, reporter created a limit
statement which doesn't work with default burst value (limit rate 1).

I'm not against omitting the burst, but it must not become a problem
then. So my idea to keep the benefits of both was to implement an "auto
burst value" which adjusts to the rate value. Do you think that's
feasible? Maybe something simple like 'burst = max(1, rate / 10)' (for
packets).

Cheers, Phil
