Yeah, my bad, I was thinking about the Service implementation and the
need to track multiple connections for the same DNAT, and this is
about embedded IPs.

Ok, k8s support, here by dragons, taking some licenses for keeping the
explanation simple:
k8s orchestrate containers with a flat network as model, as every
container needs to talk to other containers in the cluster without
NAT, there is nothing kubernetes mandates about protocols here, only
about how the network in the cluster should look like, this end to end
principle makes networking "simple" to think about and put the
complexity on the endpoints.

k8s also offers a mechanism for service discovery, the famous
kube-proxy that basically does DNAT to some virtual ip and Port
configured by the user, that is the thing that users can configure to
expose their containers, and this API only allow users to set TCP ,
UDP or SCTP protocols, this is what people traditional mean as
"kubernetes supports SCTP", although the use cases for this are very
niche.

The need for NAT64 in k8s is because unfortunately the world is not
IPv6 ready, so people deploy containers that pull images from
registries that are not reachable via IPv6 or use some git repository
that is IPv4 only, this traffic "from container to Internet" is the
traffic that needs a translation mechanism and is what this project
tries to solve, is a stopgap solution, just that.

The "mixing IP families inside the same cluster", so I have some
containers IPv4 and others IPv6 is something I heard people trying to
do, but that basically breaks the networking model of k8s, since means
some containers will only be able to reach other containers through
NAT, I really do not recommend that, as I do not see the benefit, is
something cool to work with, but not something I will use if I have my
company business on that cluster, you better use multiple clusters
with different network domains and ip families and communicate through
the "external to cluster" mechanisms
