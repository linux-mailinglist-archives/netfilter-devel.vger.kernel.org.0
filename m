Agreed.  I was just thinking out loud that it seems like much of what
we need could be a generic library mechanism similar to, but not quite
like, the existing idr code.

Yes, just "cont" is a bit too ambiguous considering we have both
integer values and structures being passed around.  Whatever you
decide on, a common base with separate suffixes seems like a good
idea.

FWIW, I still think the "audit container ID" : "ACID" thing is kinda funny ;)

Generally kernel functions which are "special"/private/unsafe/etc.
have a one, or two, underscore prefix.  If you don't want to add the
prefix, that's fine, but please change the name as mentioned
previously.

What protects you from info->cont going away between when you fetch
the pointer via audit_cont() to when you dereference it in
refcount_inc()?

What protects us in the case of simultaneous calls to audit_set_contid()?

Please document the relationship between the two, I worry we could
easily run into lockdep problems without a clearly defined ordering.

These were genuine questions, I'm not suggesting anything in
particular, I'm just curious about how we handle an orchestrator that
isn't continuously running ... is this possible?  Do we care?
