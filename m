See the patch I just sent to this list. I adjusted both - it simply
didn't appear to me that I could get by with reducing the cmp expression
size only. The upside though is that detecting the prefix match based on
payload expression length is quick and easy.

Someone will have to adjust nft tool, though. ;)

I changed the test to create the base ruleset using iptables-nft-restore
just as before, but create the rules in 'test' chain like so:

| nft add rule filter test ip saddr != 10.0.0.0/10 drop

The VM code is as expected:

| [ payload load 4b @ network header + 12 => reg 1 ]
| [ bitwise reg 1 = (reg=1 & 0x0000c0ff ) ^ 0x00000000 ]
| [ cmp eq reg 1 0x0000000a ]
| [ immediate reg 0 drop ]

Performance is ~7000pkt/s. So while it's faster than iptables-nft, it's
still quite a bit slower than legacy iptables despite the skipped
counters.

Cheers, Phil
