Thanks for doing this!

My script found two missing ones. Not sure if they came in late or if
you explicitly omitted them:

- 8519ab031d8022999603a69ee9f18e8cfb06645d
- f65b2d12236174d477c55e96c4027cd51185ba5e

As you know, my script relies upon Fixes: tags. I use git-notes to help
it here and there. This way I added extra Fixes: tags with correct
hashes for:

- 818cc223b052b9a3b0bc3fc28a4b7036b5898408
- 8a9f48515fb8f9aed0af04e05f4528aa0e32116f
- b4c9900c895fd55788912d62063cf107a27b68e0
- b593378b9b2470213af1892053af519801053a7e

(The list may very well be incomplete.)

Another case for git-notes is missing Fixes: tags in fixing commits.
They are important in two ways:

- Without a Fixes: tag, the script won't find the backport candidate.
- If backported manually, the script won't find potential follow-ups
  (fixes may have fixes, too).

In 1.0.6.y, I see 33 commits having no Fixes: tag. Did you solve this
locally with git-notes? Assuming history rewriting is allowed in the
stable branch, one could update the backports with Fixes: tags as
needed and write a custom collect_backports.sh which operates on the
stable branch directly.

An alternative might be to publish notes somehow. According to the man
page, it seems possible to keep them in a branch but I have no idea how
this works.

Cheers, Phil
