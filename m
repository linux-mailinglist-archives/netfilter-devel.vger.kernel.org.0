I guess this is the typical "problem" situation in which userspace uses
a non-zeroed buffer to feed into sendto() and due to padding not
every byte was written to. So basically userspace "leaks" garbage to
kernel, which is something I'd consider harmless and merely a minor
inconvenience when analyzing with valgrind. I usually suffer from this
as well since libmnl()'s allocation routines don't zero the buffer
either.

In your case, I'd say the error message disappears if you add
'memset(&u, 0, sizeof(u))' to the beginning of nfq_set_mode().

Cheers, Phil
