Yes, I had the same thought already. It is quite unintuitive how we link
cache completeness to certain commands. :)

Regarding your problem, maybe cache_update() should exit immediately if
passed cmd is CMD_INVALID? Unless I miss something, if cache_evaluate()
returns that value, we don't need a cache at all.
