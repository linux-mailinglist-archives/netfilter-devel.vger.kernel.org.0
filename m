We are also seeing some RST drops during live migration of a NFS
server (whose traffic goes through the filter before reaching the NFS
clients). Basically the NFS server will send RSTs during live migration,
and some of them are dropped, but we still don't understand the root
cause in this case. I will send another patch in case it turns out to be
an issue in in tcp conntrack.

Yes, for the moment the proposed patch avoids the SYN -> RST -> drop
situation, so many thanks for taking it.
