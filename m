You mean src/json.c? If so, I'm against that. We'd introduce overhead
just for an internal use-case.

Define "stable" in the context of ECMA-404 (the JSON standard).

Not arbitrarily. But I don't see a point in having to adjust the dumps
if it does. If the testsuite is tolerant to these changes, it even makes
it easier to assert their correctness. Adjusting dumps to actually
incorrect output is a not uncommon human error, especially if it's a
bulk change.

Why is it a good thing? Also, in the context of resulting patches
exceeding limits, is it easy?

That's an argument for a proper JSON parser and against your
minimalistic replacements using sed.

Just look at the diffs in this patch - for me it's impossible to assert
only the handle value changes in the dumps and nothing else. Can you
really work with unified diffs of 600 character lines?

It's bad because the diffs in patches remain unreadable. It's just an
alternative if the dumps have to remain the same, but I don't see a
reason for that.

Please have a look at nft-tests.py and how it creates *.json.got files.
