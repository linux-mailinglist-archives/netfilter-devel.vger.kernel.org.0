I think it should be possible to do some pretty print, something like:

        conntrack v1.4.6 (conntrack-tools)
        Line 1-3: 3 flow entries have been created.
        Line 4: 1 flow entries have been deleted.
        ...

One possibility is that we skip the pretty print by now, ie. you
rebase your patch on top of conntrack-tools, get it merged upstream.
Then incrementally we look at adding the pretty print for stats.

So the batch processing stops on the first error, right?

I have pushed them out, any mistake please let me know I'll fix it.

Thanks.
