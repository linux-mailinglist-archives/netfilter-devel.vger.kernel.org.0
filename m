Yes, if no packet was seen after the flow got moved back to software and
a new connection request is made while table is full.

Yes.  The problem is that AFAIU HW may move flow back to SW path after
it saw e.g. FIN bit, or after one side went silent (i.e., unacked data).

And and in that case, SW path has a lot smaller timeout than the 5day
established value.

AFAICS there is no way to detect this on generic side and it might even
be different depending on hw/driver?
