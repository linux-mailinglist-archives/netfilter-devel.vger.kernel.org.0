Ah! Originally this comes from a Red Hat BZ, not sure what reporter
actually tested with but as long as the comment started with a dash and
contained a 't' somewhere it would trigger the bug.

I wrote the test case along with the new implementation, searching for
things that could be mismatched. The '-?t' for instance is to make sure
combined short-options are matched correctly: Since '?' is not a valid
short option (at least not in iptables), this must not match as '-t'
option.

I don't quite like this check, hence I don't overly cling to it. As you
see, checking for presence of an option in getopt() format is not easy
and we do that for every option of every rule in a dump. Maybe we should
really just append the explicit table param and accept that user's table
option is not rejected but simply ignored.

Cheers, Phil
