Right.

So, you would consolidate this in one single rule? So there is one
single lookup to obtain the IP address and the destination port for
the stateless packet mangling.

Not yet.

You mean, the original header field that was just mangled? Like
matching on the former IP address before the mangling?

But this is to achieve the atomic mangling that you describe above or
you have something else in mind? You would like to store the former IP
daddr in some scratchpad area that can be accessed later on, right?

Thanks.
