Patches from 1 to 7, they look good to me. Would it be possible to
apply these patches independently from this batch or they are a strong
dependency?

I think it's better if we go slightly different direction?

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netfilter-devel/patch/20200723121553.7400-1-pablo@netfilter.org/

Instead of adding more functions into libnftnl for specific list
handling, which are not used by nft, use linux list native handling.

I think there is not need to cache the full nftnl_table object,
probably it should be even possible to just use it to collect the
attributes from the kernel to populate the nft_table object that I'm
proposing.

IIRC embedded people complained on the size of libnftnl, going this
direction I suggest, we can probably deprecated iterators for a number
of objects and get it slimmer in the midrun.

WDYT?
