I don't think its that bad.  In most cases, no restart is required
as no expired elements in the interesting range will ever be found.

I think its fine really, no need to go for two trees or anything
like pipapo is doing.

I have a few patches that build on top of this, first one
gets rid of async worker and places it in commit.
