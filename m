Hi Florian.

I hope this patch reflects your suggestion to add a 'v1' match revision
to nfacct. To be sincere, I'm not sure if should have also written
nfacct_mt_v1() and etc, since these would be pretty much duplicate code.


Please let me know if this patch needs more work.

Best regards,
Juliana.
