Sorry, I'm not sure I understand if this advice can be applied to the
discussed nit.

Good suggestion, thank you! Probably it would be more simple to make a
single restrict_tcp() helper and pass appropriate access right to it:

if (variant->sandbox == TCP_SANDBOX)
	restrict_tcp(_metadata, self,
		LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_{LISTEN|BIND|CONNECT}_TCP);

Ok, agreed

Ok, using such macros in tests might be really confusing.

Yeah, ofc we can do this if you think we need a smoother refactoring
process. We can discuss initial changes in dedicated topic [1].

Do you mean making is_restricted_{bind|connect|listen}()? We can't
identify which access rights are restricted for the port if we pass only
`variant` to test_bind_and_connect().
