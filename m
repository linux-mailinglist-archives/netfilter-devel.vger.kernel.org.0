Hm, yes, it is. I just thought it was a "good idea" to use size_t for
"sizes", but this is so implementation-specific that u32 would make
total sense (it's enough for 32GiB), and avoid holes on 64-bit archs.

Right. I forgot about that when I added 'bb'.

Yes, makes sense.

'*scratch' is actually needed at lookup time for implementations that
don't need stricter alignment than natural one, but I could probably
use some macro trickery and "move" it as needed.

I'm not sure how to deal with fields after f[0], syntactically. Do you
have some, er, pointers?
