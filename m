Ah, thanks! I didn't know the term.

Yes, I'm fine with keeping the subject if a description is added.

Well yes, roughly 10% of all commits in nftables repo are. In iptables
repo it's even worse with close to 50%. Thanks a lot for providing the
script, BTW! :)

Sorry for not checking the guideline but quoting advice I once received
from the top of my head instead. Maybe I was incorrect and in obvious
cases the description is optional. The relevant text in [2] at least
doesn't explicitly state it is, while being pretty verbose about it
regarding cover letters.

Cheers, Phil
