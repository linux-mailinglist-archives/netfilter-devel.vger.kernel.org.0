Right.  integer will work fine.  We will need a pseudotype
for 'typeof', tcp dport won't work as-is because nftables won't
know it needs to do the offset thing under the hood (math op or
flag or whatever).

Yes.

Yes.  This will also mean you can't mix real port value with offsets.
(which i don't think is a problem).

What should happen if you add, say, 20k, but the packet dport is larger
than (0xffff - 20k) ?

If I undertand correctly, with current iptables this will be placed
in the desired offset range, rather than wrap back to 0.

Ok, right, I don't think there is anything bad with your proposal
either.

Even Jeremys rebased kernel patchset looks fine to me, I just dislike
the proposed syntax (since it follows the iptables one which I don't
like either :-) )
