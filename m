Conntrack assumes you have see all traffic that belongs the flow for
other protocols too.

Then just set up a short ESTABLISHED when multihoming is in place
since the beginning.

I think it would preferrable to add some configuration via ruleset to
track SCTP over UDP, rather than deranking SCTP to become almost
stateless.

For this DTLS case it should be possible to fall back to the SCTP
"stateless" approach.

I guess similar problem will occur with MP-TCP, and I am not sure
taking TCP to be more stateless is the way to address this.

I assume this is already fixed.

Another possibility would be to introduce this alternative
state-machine and use it for multihoming?
