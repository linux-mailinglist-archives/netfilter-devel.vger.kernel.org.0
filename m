Only if it sees the second expression: If NFTA_RULE_ACTUAL_EXPR is
present, the kernel will copy the content of NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS into
a buffer pointed to by nft_rule::dump_expr. It does not inspect the
content apart from nla_policy checking which merely ensures it's a
nested array of elements conforming to nft_expr_policy (i.e., have a
NAME and DATA attribute).

The copied data is touched only by nf_tables_fill_rule_info() which
copies it as-is into the skb. Later, nf_tables_rule_destroy() just frees
the whole blob.

So effectively the kernel doesn't know or care what expressions are
contained in NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS.

Sure, I'll give it a try.
