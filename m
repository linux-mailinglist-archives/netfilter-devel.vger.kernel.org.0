Rationale was that if you have no rules that check on labels then
there is never a need to allocate the space.

I'm working on a patchset that will also set/enable the label
extension if its enabled on the template. The idea is to convert
ovs and act_ct to it, currently they point-blank increment
net->ct.labels_used which means that all conntrack objects get the
label area allocated.

But thats not what the counter was (originally) meant to convey, it
was really 'number of connlabel rules'.

As soon as act_ct or ovs modules are loaded, then all the namespaces
see 'I need conntrack labels', which completely voids all attempts to
avoid ct->ext allocation.
