So flow entry would remain in place if fin packet is seen. Then, an
ack packet will follow fastpath while another fin packet in the other
direction will follow classic.

Conntrack will have to deal then with an entry that is completely
out-of-sync, will that work? At least a fixup to disable sequence
tracking will be required?

I see.

If fin does not tear down the flow entry, then the flow entry remains
in place and it holds a reference to the conntrack object, which will
not be release until 30 seconds of no traffic activity, right?

Maybe I am just missing part of what you have in mind, I still don't
see the big picture.

Would you make a quick summary of the proposed new logic?

Thanks!
