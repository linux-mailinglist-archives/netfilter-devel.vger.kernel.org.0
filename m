In 3ab02db5f836a ("cache: add NFT_CACHE_UPDATE and NFT_CACHE_FLUSHED
flags"), you introduced NFT_CACHE_UPDATE to control whether
rule_evaluate() should call rule_cache_update(), probably assuming the
latter function merely changes cache depending on current command. In
fact, this function also links rules if needed (see call to
link_rules()).

The old code you replaced also did not always call rule_cache_update(),
but that was merely for sanity: If cache doesn't contain rules, there is
no point in updating it with added/replaced/removed rules. The implicit
logic is if we saw a rule command with 'index' reference, cache would be
completed up to rule level (because of the necessary index to handle
translation).

I'm not sure why you introduced NFT_CACHE_UPDATE in the first place, but
following my logic (and it seems to serve no other purpose) I would set
that flag whenever NFT_CACHE_RULE_BIT gets set. So IMHO,
NFT_CACHE_UPDATE is redundant.

Cheers, Phil
