I think that we use free_const() is correct.


Look at "struct datatype", which are either immutable global instances,
or heap allocated (and ref-counted). For the most part, we want to
treat these instances (both constant and allocated) as immutable, and
the "const" specifier expresses that well.

Except, we still want to use ref/unref operations (which are called
datatype_get()/datatype_free()). Those operate on "const struct
datatype *", otherwise they would require a cast all the time (which is
cumbersome and on the contrary decreases type-safety).

It also means, the "refcnt" field of a "const struct datatype *" gets
mutated by ref/unref, and that's correct. See also, C++'s "mutable"
type qualifiers.

The free_const() usage is a consequence of that, and in many cases
correct. There might be places where we wrongly treat mutable data via
const-pointers. Those should be fixed. See "[PATCH nft 1/4] datatype:
don't return a const string from cgroupv2_get_path()" for an example.
