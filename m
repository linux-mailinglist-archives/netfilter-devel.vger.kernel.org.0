I suggest there's bound to be confusion whilstever libnetfilter_queue and the
other libraries support two APIs. The question is how to minimise this
confusion. 3 suggestions:

1. Split out the old API functions to their own library, say libnfnetlink_queue.

2. Don't tag functions at all, but put something very obvious at the head of
mainpage(*) explaining thare are 2 ABIs and the pros & cons of each.

3. Tag the libnfnetlink-based functions with something other than DEPRECATED.
"OLD API" was my suggestion, do you have another?

How about this re-worded paragraph (in the COMMIT message, *not* the
documentation!):

The libnfnetlink-based functions were tagged DEPRECATED but they are not. Change
DEPRECATED to "OLD API" and update the main page to explain the difference.

I was really hoping for comments on the rest of the patch. Would you find time
to take a look?

Others have tried. Recall this conversation:

With regard to nfq_open_nfnl() and nfq_nfnlh(): neither of these are documented.
Anyone using them has found them in the source. They are also using libnfnetlink
directly.

My first step in moving to libmnl would to to make those two static, or at least
remove EXPORT_SYMBOL for them. If anyone complains, tell them to copy from
source into their application.

(*) Soon to double as libnetfilter_queue.7, if you apply that patch once I've
finished it.

Cheers ... Duncan.
