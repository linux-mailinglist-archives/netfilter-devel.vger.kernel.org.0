Using *nm -D* (dynamic symbols) I see
 - libmnl.so: no U (undefined) symbols satisfied by libnfnetlink.so
 - nfq (my app): no U symbols satisfied by libnfnetlink.so
 - libnetfilter_queue.so: many U symbols satisfied by libnfnetlink.so
Only way to tell whether the libnfnetlink.so references in libnetfilter_queue.so
are confined to the deprecated functions would be to do a build without them.
If that eliminates libnfnetlink references, then maybe we could think about a
configure option to not build them (also excluding them from the doco).
But that's for another day - I'll get back to libnetfilter_queue doco for now.

Cheers ... Duncan.
