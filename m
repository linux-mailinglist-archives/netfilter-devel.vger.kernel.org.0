What do you mean by no output?

# nft -v
nftables v1.1.5 (Commodore Bullmoose #6)
# nft describe icmp code
payload expression, datatype icmp_code (icmp code) (basetype integer), 8 bits
# nft describe icmpv6 code
payload expression, datatype icmpv6_code (icmpv6 code) (basetype integer), 8 bits

As for your lengthy notes, it is easier for us if you send us
individual patches for each issue that can be reviewed.

This is more work on your side, but less work on us to digest this
lengthy notes.

Thanks.
