Could you rebase and resend the kernel patches now that the
refactoring patches have been merged?

I'd like to have another look at it now that the fixes and
refactoring ones are in.

Background: I wonder if going with NF_NAT_RANGE_PROTO_OFFSET
is really a good idea or not, because it seems rather iptables-kludgy.

But if its not much work it might be simpler to jsut go along with it.
An alternate approach would be to support addition in nft, so one
could do:

dnat to tcp dport + 2000

... to get such a 'shift effect'.

[ yes, the bison parser might not like this syntax, I made it up for
illustrative purposes. ]

Something like this would also allow to emulate TTL/HL target of
iptables, ATM we can set a fixed value but cannot add or decrement
them.

Thanks.
