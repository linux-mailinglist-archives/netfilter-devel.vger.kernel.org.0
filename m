Subject: nftables documentation improvement?

Dear netfilter project,

In my recent interaction explaining nftables to some other users I am
under the impression that there is likely some improvement possible to
the nftables wiki.

The wiki is full of details about the individual expressions, actions,
etc. - but I think what's lacking (or I couldn't find it) is some kind
of conscise overall description of the terminology + the general
high-level architecture of the ruleset.

You can find some description in the first two paragraphs of 
https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Simple_rule_management
but that doesn't define the terms used (action, expression, statement,
...)

You can find an overview of the terms used in
https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Quick_reference-nftables_in_10_minutes
[but then actually with imprecise language like "rule refers to an
action to be configured within a chain." while a rule actually consists
of matching expressions and an action"]

I'd be willing to try to write a proposed improvded text expressing what
I have in mind.  I'd prefer to do that as some separate wiki page as a
draft for you guys to review before deciding whether to use it in the
main wiki pages.  I just didn't want to write it as unformatted
plain-text here in e-mail and then later have to re-format in wiki
syntax.

So in short: If anybody would be willing to add an account for me, I'd
give it a shot and you can decide if you think what I'd consider an
improvement is also one in your point of view.

Thanks,
	Harald

p.s.: I'm not subscribed to the list since becoming emeritus status a long
time ago, so please Cc me in any responses.
