Sure.

Well, the list was already there, but based on older document. Link to
current one is added at the top of this chunk:
	/* https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xhtml */

I could have replaced the comments with actual assignments, like:

	IPFIX_engineId			= 41

but I personally don't like creating entities that are not used in the
rest of the code. I personally prefer doing (uncommenting) this on entry-by-entry
basis, when something get's actually implemented.
This approach gives some insight about implementation status.

There the rationale was - up to this point we got _all_ the assignments
(continuously). But as we go further, there is more and more data types
that won't be ever implemented.

Actually the question should be: what was the purpose of this listing?

https://git.netfilter.org/ulogd2/commit/include/ulogd/ipfix_protocol.h?id=570f2229563fb8101b1ba0369eeda1f19dbc88ee

Anyway - this chunk is actually redundant (except from the source
document), so I think I'll simply drop this. No need for copy&paste IANA.

These are disabled, because they're simply not correct. Left in place as a
comment just to left a warning for future updates.

https://git.netfilter.org/ulogd2/commit/input/flow/ulogd_inpflow_NFCT.c?id=6b4b8aa3a9612f1c92e885ac71a503321cabd69e

I might as well simply change it to ".ipfix = { }".
