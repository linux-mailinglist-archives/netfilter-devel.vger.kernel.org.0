Fine with me.

Yes, NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS is the 'compat kludge',
NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS_ACTUAL the active one.

Yep.

Right.  I don't mind but its perhaps a bit clearer as to what is going
on.

Actually you don't need a maxlen at all, sorry.  I saw the nla_len and
thought NLA_BINARY but you could do this:

-       [NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS] = { .type = NLA_NESTED },
+       [NFTA_RULE_EXPRESSIONS] = NLA_POLICY_NESTED_ARRAY(nft_expr_policy),


... and use the same for the COMPAT_EXPRESSIONS (or whatever name
will be chosen).

(This won't do full validation of all attributes because the policy
 for expr 'X' isn't known at compile time).

I was just wondering if we should at least verify that netlink
attributes and sizes match, not that the expressions themselves are
parseable/available.

But its impossible to do so if the expression isn't available because
we then have no policy either.

So perhaps above NLA_POLICY_NESTED_ARRAY() is enough after all.
