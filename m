Hi there,

this patch is giving me some trouble as it breaks deletion of conntrack 
entries in software that doesn't set the version flag to anything else 
but 0.

I'm not entirely sure what is going on here but a piece of software I am 
using is now unable to delete conntrack entries and is therefor not 
functioning.
Specifically this piece of code seems to fail:
https://github.com/wlanslovenija/tunneldigger/blob/master/broker/src/tunneldigger_broker/conntrack.py#L112

That software relies heavily on libnetfilter_conntrack, which itself, 
with this patch, seems to be broken as well:

   [felix@x1 utils]$ sudo ./conntrack_create

   TEST: create conntrack (OK)

   [felix@x1 utils]$ sudo ./conntrack_delete

   TEST: delete conntrack (-1)(No such file or directory)


If in libnetfilter_conntrack I edit utils/conntrack_delete.c and change 
the line

   nfct_set_attr_u8(ct, ATTR_L3PROTO, AF_INET);


to read

   nfct_set_attr_u8(ct, ATTR_L3PROTO, AF_UNSPEC);


it starts working again.

As I said, I haven't entirely figured out why this patch breaks 
previously working software and what I need to do on my end to unbreak 
my software that is using libnetfilter_conntrack. I haven't found a way 
to make libnetfilter_conntrack set any other version than NFNETLINK_V0 
for the messages it sends, which I presume would fix my problem.

Any hints would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
   Felix
