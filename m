Downside is that this flag adds more complexity, since there will be
two paths to test (flag on/off).

Another concern is having a lot of devices, this is now interating
linearly performing strcmp() to find matches from the control plane
(ie. maybe this slow down time to load ruleset?), IIRC you mentioned
this should not be an issue.

Mistyped name is another scenario this flag could help.

If this flag is added, I won't allow for updates until such
possibility is carefully review, having all possible tricky scenarios
in mind.

I think it boils down to the extra complexity that this flag adds is
worth having or documenting the new behaviour is sufficient, assuming
the two issues that have been mentioned are not problematic.
