Uhm... well the point of any sandboxing is always (at least trying to)
prevent any attacks.

Sure, nftables is probably not the most likely program to be abused (in
particular as it usually won't process untrusted input), but still even
nftables can't be 100% sure to never be abused in something like
secretly included malware or so.

As with the first patchset my idea was simply that *if* a .service file
is shared it could as well be proper and use as many sandboxing options
from systemd as possible, serving as and example for e.g. downstream
versions of such .service.

Wasn't 100% sure whether it might e.g. write to some locations like
/proc/sys/net in special situations.

The idea of PrivateTmp=3Dyes (in addition to ProtectSystem=3Dstrict) was
rather to prevent that nftables would be able to read anyone else's
files in /tmp (and /var/tmp), again for sandboxing reasons.

Uhm... do you have any reason to believe that the options below were
less tested? It seems at least some of them are used by system's own
units, so these are probably used on basically every system, and most
of what systemd does there is, AFAIU, merely using stuff the kernel
provides via namespaces.
Also *if* something would actually fail, then nft would probably just
terminate with some error or via some signal and it would be quickly
spotted.


Anyway, as said, none of this needs to be done at all... I merely did
the work to went through all these options and which could be used with
nft -f, so that other could perhaps benefit from that, too.


Cheers,
Chris.
