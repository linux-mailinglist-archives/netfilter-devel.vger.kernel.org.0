Yes, although "conntrack -E" does not display verification tags. These 
are the first 3 notifications of an association as printed by "conntrack 
-E" (output truncated after src=):
     [NEW] ipv4     2 sctp     132 3 src=
  [UPDATE] ipv4     2 sctp     132 3 src=
  [UPDATE] ipv4     2 sctp     132 3 COOKIE_ECHOED src=
As you see, there is no connection state printed in the first two 
notifications.

I used a custom tool which can print verification tags and formats its 
output similarly to "conntrack -E":
     [NEW] ipv4     2 sctp     132 3 0 0 src=
  [UPDATE] ipv4     2 sctp     132 3 0 0 src=
  [UPDATE] ipv4     2 sctp     132 3 COOKIE_ECHOED 50ced389 e967350e src=
The tags are printed as zero in the first two notifications, but that 
rather means the tags have not been received in the notification. The 
above test was done under Linux 5.5-rc4.
