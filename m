FYI, **this does turn out to work** (I just fumbled in my first experiment)=
. --
It is possible to reset a listening socket with shutdown() into a state whe=
re it
can be used for at least a new connect(2), and maybe also for new listen(2)=
s.

The same might also be possible if a socket is in the TCP_SYN_SENT state at=
 the
time of shutdown() (although that is a bit trickier to try out).

So a complete disassociation control for TCP/IP might not only need to have
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_CONNECT_UNSPEC (or however we'd call it), but also
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_SOCKET_PASSIVE_SHUTDOWN and maybe even another one for the
TCP_SYN_SENT case...? *

It makes me uneasy to think that I only looked at AF_INET{,6} and TCP so fa=
r,
and that other protocols would need a similarly close look.  It will be
difficult to cover all the "disassociation" cases in all the different
protocols, and even more difficult to detect new ones when they pop up.  If=
 we
discover new ones and they'd need new Landlock access rights, it would also
potentially mean that existing Landlock users would have to update their ru=
les
to spell that out.

It might be easier after all to not rely on "disassociation" control too mu=
ch
and instead to design the network-related access rights in a way so that we=
 can
provide the desired sandboxing guarantees by restricting the "constructive"
operations (the ones that initiate new network connections or that listen o=
n the
network).

Mikhail, in your email I am quoting above, you are saying that "disassociat=
ion
control can be really useful"; do you know of any cases where a restriction=
 of
connect/listen is *not* enough and where you'd still want the disassociatio=
n
control?

(In my mind, the disassociation control would have mainly been needed if we=
 had
gone with Micka=C3=ABl's "Use socket's Landlock domain" RFC [1]?  Micka=C3=
=ABl and me have
discussed this patch set at LSS and I am also now coming around to the
realization that this would have introduced more complication.  - It might =
have
been a more "pure" approach, but comes at the expense of complicating Landl=
ock
usage.)

* for later reference, my reasoning in the code is: net/ipv4/af_inet.c
  implements the entry points for connect() and listen() at the address fam=
ily
  layer.  Both operations require that the sock->state is SS_UNCONNECTED.  =
So
  the rest is going through the other occurrences of SS_UNCONNECTED in that=
 same
  file to see if there are any places where the socket can get back into th=
at
  state.  The places I found where it is set to that state are:
 =20
  1. inet_create (right after creation, expected)
  2. __inet_stream_connect in the AF_UNSPEC case (known issue)
  3. __inet_stream_connect in the case of a failed connect (expected)
  4. inet_shutdown in the case of TCP_LISTEN or TCP_SYN_SENT (mentioned abo=
ve)
