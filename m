OK, my patch is not covering all the possible cases then.

Probably we can remove the hooks from .pre_exit, then force a run of
the garbage collector from there. Then .exit path skips event delivery
as my patch does.

This would allow to remove the per-netns callback workaround, and all
would be handled from nf_conntrack instead?
