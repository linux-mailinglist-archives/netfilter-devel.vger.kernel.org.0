It was only ever tested with i686 binary on amd64 arch.

Thomas, does unmodified 32bit iptables work on those arch/kernel
combinations?

ebtables-userspace compat fixups predate the ebtables kernel side
support, it was autoenabled on sparc64 in the old makefile:

ifeq ($(shell uname -m),sparc64)
CFLAGS+=-DEBT_MIN_ALIGN=8 -DKERNEL_64_USERSPACE_32
endif

I don't even know if the ebtables compat support is compiled in on
non-amd64.
