Yes, we have a lot of short lived UDP flows related to a DNS server service.

We collect flow termination events using ulogd and forward them as JSON
messages over UDP to fluentd. Since these flows are reaped every 2 minutes,
we see spikes in UDP rx drops due to fluentd not keeping up with the bursts.

We planned to configure this to run every 10s or so, which should be
sufficient for our workloads, and monitor these spikes in order to tune
further as needed.

Eyal.
