I think the key is to be able to identify what elements have been
flushed by what flush command, so abort path can just restore/undo the
state for the given elements.

Because this also is possible:

       flush set x + [...] + flush set x

And [...] includes possible new/delete elements in x.

It should be possible to store an flush command id in the set element
(this increases the memory consumption of the set element, which your
series already does it) to identify what flush command has deleted it.
This is needed because the transaction object won't be in place but I
think it is a fair tradeoff. The flush command id can be incremental
in the batch (the netlink sequence number cannot be used for this
purpose).

Of course, this needs careful look, but if the set element can be used
to annotate the information that allows us to restore to previous
state before flush (given the transaction object is not used anymore),
then it should work. Your series is extending the set element size for
a different purpose, so I think the extra memory should not be an
issue.
