Thinking more about this, this makes sense from the point of view of the
network stack, but looking at external (potentially bogus) firewalls or
malware detection systems, it is something different.  If we don't
provide a way for users to differenciate the control of SCTP from TCP,
malicious use of SCTP could still bypass this kind of bogus security
appliances.  It would then be safer to stick to the protocol semantic by
clearly differenciating TCP from MPTCP (or any other protocol).

Mikhail, could you please send a new patch series containing one patch
to fix the kernel and another to extend tests?  We should also include
this rationale in the commit message.

It would be nice to add support for MPTCP too, but this will be treated
as a new Landlock feature (with a proper ABI bump).
