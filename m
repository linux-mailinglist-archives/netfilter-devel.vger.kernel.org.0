Here's part of that discussion:

It was added because an audit test that normally produced records from
iptables on one distro stopped producing any records on another.
Investigation led to the fact that on the first it was using
iptables-legacy API and on the other it was using iptables-nft API.

This was the goal.  iptables was atomic.  nftables appears to no longer
be so.  If I have this wrong, please show how that works.

If it were to be disabled "at will" it would defeat the purpose of
audit.  Those records can already be filtered, or audit can be disabled,
but let us look at rationalizing the current nftables records first.
