Could you please trim this down to the relevant parts
and add a more human-readable description as to where the problem is,
under which circumstances this happens and why the
!SEEN_REPLY_BIT test is bogus?

Keep in mind that you know more about synproxy than I do, so its
harder for me to follow what you're doing when the commit message consists
of tcpdump output.

... its not obvious to me why a reset is generated here in first place,
and why changing code in TCP_CLOSE case helps?
(I could guess the hook was called in postrouting and close transition
 came from rst that was sent, but that still doesn't explain why it
 was sent to begin with).

I assume the hostname "netfilter" is the synproxy machine, and
192.168.122.1 is a client we're proxying for, right?
