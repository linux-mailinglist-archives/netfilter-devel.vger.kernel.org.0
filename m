This also looks consistent with stateful objects:

- reset counter [<fam>] <counter>
- reset counters table [<fam>] table <table>
- reset counters [<fam>]

This would require to make two calls, one to NFT_MSG_GETOBJ_RESET and
another to NFT_MSG_GETRULE_RESET:

> - reset chain (for 'reset rules chain')

This could be implemented with the new NFT_MSG_GETRULE_RESET, which
already allows to filter with chain.

So these two would only require userspace code, this can be done
later.

Yes, first should reset everything that is stateful and that is
contained in the table.

As said, this can be implemented later on from userspace.

This is addressing all my questions then, I'm going to put this into
nf-next.

Thanks for explaining.
