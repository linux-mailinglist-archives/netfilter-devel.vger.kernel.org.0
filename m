If you use AS_IF above, you could also make use of it here :)

This looks like it could break anytime (say, when it happens to get to 9
files). Can't it test for a specific filename or set of names?

The syntax for POSIX sh-compatible functions should be

	main() { ...

>+function setgroup { mv $$1.3 $$2.3; BASE=$$2; };\
>+function add2group { for i in $$@; do ln -sf $$BASE.3 $$i.3; done; };\

Should be quoted, i.e. "$$@". Might as well do it for the other vars.
