No idea... is there actually a standard's document somewhere that
actually describes which header file should declare what (and under
what #define conditions)?

Without it, I have absolutely no idea...
glibc also has tons of headers that require #define SOMETHING before
including them in order to get them to declare certain things.

I have no idea why the #ifdef BSD guard is there in bionic... maybe
it's wrong, maybe it's compatible with some other libc header files...
It doesn't really feel like the sort of thing that would be added by
mistake (ie. it feels very intentional)...

But changing bionic (for example to remove the #ifdef), feels scarier,
because it affects all things using bionic (including android app
native code I think), as opposed to just a single file in iptables...
