It's OK if you prefer this way. I can see references on the web to
reseting multiple options, not sure if it is actually useful in
practise, in such you can to parse the packet several times.

'reset' also exists as a token. This is setting to nop, I just though
reset might make more sense, there might be a nice to really remove
TCP options in the future (costful but paranoid scenario, an observer
can spot options that have been nop)
