It is working for me, both with IPv4 and IPv6, and I suspect the reason is that
I am using this for multicast packets. In particular, I have a macvlan and I want to join multicast groups on the macvlan interface but I want the IGMP/MLD join group messages to be sent with the MAC address of the "parent" interface of the macvlan, and not the mac address of the macvlan itself.

The rules I am using are:
 map vmac_map {
	type iface_index : iface_index
	elements = { "macvlan0" : "eth0" }
 }

 ip protocol igmp dup to ip daddr device oif map @vmac_map drop
and
 icmpv6 type mld2-listener-report dup to ip6 daddr device oif map @vmac_map drop

With many thanks for your help,

Quentin
