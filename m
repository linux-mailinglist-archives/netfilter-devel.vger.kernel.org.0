nft_do_chain_inet() is called from the NFPROTO_INET hook, which
results in either NFPROTO_IPV4 or NFPROTO_IPV6.

This is hot path, I would not add more code there. The default case is
just there to avoid a warning from gcc.

Probably a comment like /* Should not ever happen */ for the default
case in nft_do_chain_inet() is fine with you? :)

I think so, that's fine indeed.
