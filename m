I don't recall why I chose to add setters/getters for individual output
flags instead of expecting users to do bit-fiddling. Maybe the latter is
not as common among Python users. :)

On the other hand, things are a bit inconsistent already, see
set_debug() method. 

Maybe we could turn __{get,set}_output_flag() public and make them
accept an array of strings or numbers just like set_debug()? If you
then adjust your input flag API accordingly, things become consistent
(enough?), without breaking existing users.

FWIW, I find

| ctx.set_output_flags(["reversedns", "stateless"])

nicer than

| ctx.set_output_flags(REVERSEDNS | STATELESS)

at least with a Python hat on. WDYT?

Cheers, Phil
