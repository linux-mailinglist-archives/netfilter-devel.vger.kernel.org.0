And register tracking is done per rule, given context is per rule too,
good.

I wonder if it is worth to move the bitmask away from nft_ctx, given
this structure is stored in the struct nft_trans, hence increasing the
size of this object which is not required at a later state, maybe
there is a need for a new container structure that store data useful
for the initial preparation step of the commit protocol.
