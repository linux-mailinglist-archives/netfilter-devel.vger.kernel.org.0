I'm fine with this initial version, will wait for others to have a
look into this to give feedback.

On your side: I would like to know if you will commit to extend this
and make improvements incrementally, in particular, making a follow up
patch to add IPv6 support I'd suggest, among other things.

A --output option would be good to specify what directory and file
name will be used to store the autogenerated .nft file.

Thanks.
