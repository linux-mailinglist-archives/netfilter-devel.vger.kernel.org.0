Nice, I wasn't aware of that one. Anyway, this isn't really redundant
as it also checks that sets are reported back correctly (which I
expected to break, even if it didn't) by comparing with the dump file,
instead of just checking netlink messages.

So I'd actually suggest that we keep this and I'd send another patch
(should I repost this series? A separate patch?) to enable the rule you
added for py tests.
