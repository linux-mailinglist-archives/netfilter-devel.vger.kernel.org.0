That seems like reasonable rationale. I like to declare function
arguments as const too in order to mark them as not being altered by the
function.

With strings, I find it odd to do:

const char *buf = strdup("foo");
free((void *)buf);

No, I was just wondering why we have this need for free_const() in the
first place (i.e., why we declare pointers as const if we allocate/free
them).

I believe this is exactly what Thomas is trying to move away from. IIUC,
he wants to have a "special" free() to mark the spots where a const
pointer is freed (and make it a more deliberate action).

Cheers, Phil
