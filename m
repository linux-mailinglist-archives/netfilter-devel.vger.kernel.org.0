HTML and PDF are completely different beasts in their own right.
The use of \- e.g. actually breaks copy-and-paste with PDF. But:

 * I am being told that's all expected
   https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/groff/2023-10/msg00052.html ,
 * manpages' primary target is the console anyway,
 * because copying PDF text injects a helluva lot of other artifacts
   anyway, predominantly newlines

I left PDF documentation being the third-class citizen that it is.
