Hi Pablo,

Thanks a lot for your reply.

Yes, it's a dummy device. I'm using the egress netdev hook here because
it is executed before the device's .ndo_start_xmit() is called.

Interesting, I did in fact run a 6.4 production kernel when I tried
this, and that didn't have that patch applied. Sorry for that oversight.

On 6.7, what I see is different but still broken:

This rules does the right thing and patches the source MAC correctly:

table netdev dummy {
  chain egress {
    type filter hook egress device dummy priority 0;
    ether saddr set 1:2:3:4:5:6 dup to eth0
  }
}

Whereas trying to patch the IP source addr leads to no packets being
forwarded at all anymore:

table netdev dummy {
  chain egress {
    type filter hook egress device dummy priority 0;
    ip saddr set 1.1.1.1 dup to eth0
  }
}

Interestingly, ether type filtering is also broken now, the following
also doesn't match any packets:

table netdev dummy {
  chain egress {
    type filter hook egress device dummy priority 0;
    ether type ip dup to eth0
  }
}

I browsed through the patches since 6.7 and couldn't find anything that
is related. Did I miss anything?


Best regards,
Daniel
