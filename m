Sorry, I didn't. But instead I found Bison 3.0 release notes[1], please
have a look at "Use of YACC='bison -y'" paragraph. I tried to set
YACC='bison -o y.tab.c' in configure.ac. This avoids the warnings in
parser_bison.y, but scanner.l fails to build as a macro ECHO is being
defined by bison/flex which clashes with ECHO keyword used by us.

Given that even Bison maintainer suggests to set -Wno-yacc, let's just
wait what autoconf-2.7 brings.

Speaking of parser_bison, we had a discussion at NFWS about whether to
quote all user-defined strings on output (and make sure to accept quotes
on input). Your bet was that it is possible to fix the problem of users
choosing keywords (e.g. "hour" as table name) from within bison. I tried
and came up with the following:

| --- a/src/parser_bison.y
| +++ b/src/parser_bison.y
| @@ -2021,6 +2021,8
|                         ;
|  
|  identifier             :       STRING
| +                       |       HOUR            { $$ = strdup("hour"); }
| +                       |       TABLE           { $$ = strdup("table"); }
|                         ;
|  
|  string                 :       STRING

This works in that I can create a table named "table":

| # nft add table table
| # nft list ruleset
| table ip table {
| }

But it causes shift/reduce warnings when compiling. Do you have an idea
for how to avoid the shift/reduce conflicts?

Cheers, Phil
