We don't define data types in libnftnl, merely expressions and (with
your patch) those define what byteorder the source/destination registers
are supposed to be.

For this to work, I would have to duplicate nftables' enum datatypes and
in addition to that add an array defining each type's byteorder. I had
considered this once, but didn't like the amount of duplication.

This does not work for concatenated elements, right? At least I see e.g.
NFTNL_UDATA_SET_KEYBYTEORDER being set to set->key->byteorder, so that's
just a single value, no?

Well, it extends the logic around NFTNL_SET_DESC_CONCAT to non-interval
sets and to maps (adding the same data for the target part).

Then there is the new NFTNL_SET_DESC_BYTEORDER which defines the
byteorder of each part of the key (and value in maps).

Cheers, Phil
