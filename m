Its simply not possible to validate it in kernel.

Consider e.g. 'tcp dort 80'.  nftables will insert the 'its tcp' check.

But userspace can also do
'meta l4proto { 6, 17, 132} th dport { 22, 23, 80}'.

The 'read 2 bytes from start of transport header' is the same.
So kernel cannot 'force' anything.

It will make sure that 2 bytes could be read from the given
offset.  But it can't make sure that those bytes have a particular
meaning (port for instance).

Its fully intentional, see above example.

You could submit a patch for nftables userspace to no longer
emit NFT_CT_SRC/DST, I think there is no need to support kernels < 4.17
anymore.
