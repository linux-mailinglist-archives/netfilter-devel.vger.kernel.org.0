8k is brain damaged^W^W very high for nftables thanks to the existence of
verdict maps.  The problem is iptables(-nft) and its linear rules.

What about going with 64k and NOT applying that limit in the init_netns?

The rationale would be that if you have the priviliges to ramp up the
limitation threshold that limit doesn't exist in practice anyway.

Sure, but why do you need to protect init_net?

I don't see how you can make such rulesets on accident.
