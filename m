I'm not good at knitting, always liked crocheting more. That said, I
like fast testsuites more than any of those. ;)

You could test the timeout feature just once and for all? I doubt there
will ever be a bug in that feature which only a certain data type
exposes, but you may e.g. create all the sets with elements at the same
time so waiting for the timeout once is enough.
