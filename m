Hi Jan,

First of all, thanks a lot for reviewing these "boring" changes. :)

I tried to stick to this paradigm, but it's confusing and I probably
lost track here and there. Even in your example above, "printed like
iptables-save", in mind I extend to "printed like the command
iptables-save does" and therefore choose bold font. I'm obviously not
the best candidate to make these choices.

Ah, thanks! It's misleading if output looks fine anyway.

Can you maybe clarify how to distinct between "command" and "name"? I'm
tempted to just leave things as they are instead of doing changes
randomly.

Thanks, Phil
