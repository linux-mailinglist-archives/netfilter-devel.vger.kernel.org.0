It also means there is not simple "run-tests" script without setting up
a VM/container. I personally avoid to run `sudo some/script` from the
internet (although, I execute build scripts from the internet are
normal user).

Running a substantial subset of tests as non-root, seems essential to
me.

It may not be essential to everybody, but to some.

Probably not, but does it hurt? I think it should be

  unshare -f -p -U -n --mount-proc --map-root-user \
      bash -xc 'whoami; ip link; sleep 1 & ps aux'

If you don't run with real-root, then you are maybe not testing the
full thing and miss something. Hence, you have to opt-in to the new
rootless functionality with NFT_TEST_ROOTLESS=3D1.

The check is to preserve the previous behavior, which failed without
real-root.

Which check? About NFT_TEST_HAVE_REALROOT?

We need that, to detect real-root before unshare. Since we already need
it internally, it's also documented so that the user could override it.
For example, if you develop inside a

     podman run --privileged -ti fedora:latest

then `id -u` would wrongly indicate that the test has real-root. You
can override that with `export  NFT_TEST_HAVE_REALROOT=3D0` to run in
rootless mode.

I think command line switches are inferior. They are cumbersome to
implement (in the script, the order of options surprisingly matters).
They are also more limited in their usage. The script should integrate
with a `make check-xyz` step or be called from others scripts, where
the command line is not directly editable. Also, the name
NFT_TEST_NO_UNSHARE is something unique that you can grep for (unlike
the "-g" command line switch).

The variable NFT_TEST_NO_UNSHARE is there, because the previous code
also expected a failure to `unshare`, then printed a warning and
proceeded without separate namespace. I think that fallback is
undesirable, I would not want to run the test accidentally in the main
namespace.

Now, by default it always tries to unshare, and aborts on failure. The
variable is there to opt-out from that.

These are very good points.

Parallel execution maybe happen by hooking the tests up as individual
make targets.=20


I'd like to integrate tests more into `make check-*`. I'd also like to
add unit tests (that is, both statically and dynamically link with
libnftables and to be able to unit test code specifically). As a
developer, I'd like to type `make check` to run the the unit tests and
have a clear make target for the integration tests.

IMO "[PATCH nft 0/6] no recursive make" should be done to make that
nicer. But I guess that will be controversial. Recursive make seems
very popular, all around.
