 with binary operation and flags

Allow me to add one more supplement to what I just wrote, as you/some
might say something like "but allowing `ct state related,established`
to work as expected is intuitive and neat".

Consider this:

# nft --debug=netlink add rule meh tcp_flags 'ct state == new,established'
ip
  [ ct load state => reg 1 ]
  [ cmp eq reg 1 0x0000000a ]

# nft list ruleset
table ip meh {
    chain tcp_flags {
        ct state established | new
    }
}

If `ct state new,established` is interpreted to be the same as `ct
state == new,established`, at least we *will know* that we should use
`ct state { new, established }` instead. But when it is not, we can
only *suppose* it to be *practically* the same as it. (I'm quite sure
many people think like, "nft is just not completed/smart enough yet to
be able to omit the redundant curly braces"...)
