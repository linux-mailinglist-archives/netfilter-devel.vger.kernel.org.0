It is just the commit_mutex in this section that I don't like, but OK
this operation and scenario should be rare and adding yet another lock
for a rare case might make no sense.

I think this is possible, I would like to see userspace code (just
simple sketch) that shows how complicate this is.

Counter expressions in rules are probably the more complicated to
restore. Named objects should be rather easy.

Another possibility is to explore transaction control plane path and
use NLM_F_ECHO to get back the original counters, but I would not
really follow this path.

I have been considering netlink dump based on ruleset snapshots. The
idea is: Make a snapshot of the ruleset at the beginning of the
netlink dump, this requires a new class of objects that can be used as
container to store what is going to be. The snapshot should happen
right before initiating the netlink dump holding the commit_mutex, and
it would take memory to store this temporary ruleset snapshot. The
snapshot would be done per dump request.

This ensures no EINTR can happen, the ruleset at the end of the
netlink dump will be consistent, but it might be slightly behind the
real rule if updates have happened, but using the generation ID, it
should be possible to at least report it to the user.
