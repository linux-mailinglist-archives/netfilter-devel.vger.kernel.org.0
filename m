Correct, with two caveats:

- building ranges isn't that straightforward. Some complexity currently
  in concat_range_aggregate() would go away if we embed that logic in  
  netlink_delinearize_setelem(), but most of it would remain, and that
  logic doesn't seem to belong to "netlink" functions. I guess this is
  quite subjective though

- if we keep a mechanism that can build ranges this way, the day we
  want to switch to NFTA_SET_ELEM_KEY_END for ranges in general, also
  for other set types (or without concatenation anyway), maintaining
  compatibility with older kernels, it should be easier to let
  concat_range_aggregate() handle all cases. I'm not sure, I haven't
  really thought it through

Ah, yes, I also think that would make sense.

By the way, while I didn't switch other helpers to take 'struct set' in
this series (because it didn't fit the scope), I'm quite convinced that
functions called set_is_*() should really take a 'set' as argument. :)
