I'm still not really convinced about such a feature. Why is it useful to 
know how many bytes would be sent over the "limit"? Also, there's no 
protection against overflow in the counters. I know firewalls with ipset, 
10gb interfaces and long uptimes, so it's not completely a theoretical 
issue.

That's true.

The counters are used just for statistical purposes: reflect the 
packets/bytes which were let through, i.e. matched the whole "rule".
In that case updating the counters before the counter value matching is 
evaluated gives false results.
