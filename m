Could you silent these warnings via CFLAGS just like we do with
mini-gmp.{c,h}? We already cache a copy of mini-gmp.c in the tree,
this would follow the same approach, just the source under src/ and
the header in include/.

Probably good if you can also update 'nft -v' to display that nft is
compiled with/without mini-gmp and also with either
libreadline/linenoise.

No objections, please update tests/build/ to check for this new
./configure option.

Thanks.
