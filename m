Subject: [nft PATCH 1/2] tests/py: Write dissenting payload into the right file
Date:   Wed,  3 Feb 2021 23:46:04 +0100

The testsuite supports diverging payloads depending on table family.
This is necessary since for some families, dependency matches are
created.
If a payload mismatch happens, record it into a "got"-file which matches
the family-specific payload file, not the common one. This eases use of
diff-tools a lot as the extra other families' payloads confuse the
tools.
