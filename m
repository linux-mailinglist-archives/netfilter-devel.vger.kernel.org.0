Oh, right, I guess that would work. But at a first glance it looks more
complicated than the other idea:

...hmm, no, forget about gc, that was flawed. I'm just "walking" the
tree (going through elements as a list, instead of descending it),
noting down closest left and right elements to what we're inserting,
and check it with similar criteria to what we already have (but much
simpler, because we don't have to infer anything from what might be in
other leaves/nodes).

That is, if you have elements 3 (start), 5 (end), 7 (start), 8 (end),
and you're inserting 6 as a start, we'll end up the tree walk with 5
(end) on the left and 7 (start) on the right, so we know it's not
overlapping.

If you insert 4 (as start or end), we know we have 3 and 5 around, so
it overlaps.

It's essentially the same as it is now, just dropping a lot of corner
cases and changing the way we go through the tree.

I kind of implemented it, I still need a bit to make it working.

That sounds good, but when would we call it? Can it be independent of
the userspace version? Could we then obsolete the "activate" operation
(of course, by implementing commit() in all the sets)?
