I am honestly surprised it is using this approach since copying the entire buffer over to a linear buffer would be really expensive. I am assuming this code isn't exercised often? If so I guess skb_linearize works here, but it will be much more prone to failure for larger buffers as the higher order memory allocations will be likely to fail as memory gets more fragmented over time.

It snoops the ftp control channel, so yes, this should be low overhead.

This code is ~20 years old, the original implementation is from a time when skbs were always linear.
