Hi Alberto, I was analyzing the impact to add support NAT64/46 several
months ago. It seems that you've done a very good job.

In regards to the iptables approach, do you have any benchmark
compared to the NAT in the same stack?

In regards to the nftables approach, do you mean to integrate the RFC
implementations natively into the nftables infrastructure?

Checking your code, it seems that you use several user space tools
(jool, joold) and a conntrack-like table to store the connection data.
As you know, in the nftables project it has been done a great effort
to avoid several tools for packet mangling so something natively like
the following would be probably required.

nft add table ip6 nat
nft add chain ip6 nat postrouting { type nat hook postrouting priority 100 \; }
nft add rule ip6 nat postrouting oif eth0 snat 1.2.3.4

More thorough study would be the possibility of supporting the
sessions in conntrack and conntrackd but, I believe a first approach
with stateless NAT from ingress could be a great achievement.

Cheers.
