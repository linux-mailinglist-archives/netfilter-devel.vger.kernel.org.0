Well, with NLM_F_ECHO, it should be possible to explore reset under
commit_mutex, but is it really worth the effort?

With two concurrent threads, we just want to ensure that no invalid
state shows in the listing (you mentioned it is possible to list
negative values with two threads listing-and-resetting at the same
time).

I think we should just make sure something valid is included in the
listing, but as for the two threads performing list-and-reset, why
ensure strict serialization?

This is a rare operation to fetch statistics, most likely having a
single process performing this in place? So we are currently
discussing how to fix the (negative) non-sense in the listing.
