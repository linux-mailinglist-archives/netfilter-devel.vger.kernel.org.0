FWIW, I found interesting Python code[1] dealing with that. The logic is
to open /proc/$$/ns/net before switching netns and storing the fd for
later. To exit the netns again, it is passed to setns() and then closed.
Note that the code there is much simpler and doesn't deal with mounts or
non-existing entries in /var/run/netns/. Maybe libnftables doesn't need
to either and it is OK to just bail if given netns doesn't exist?

Yes, that's also the only way to operate in multiple netns in parallel.

I just think that a routine which affects things outside of nft scope
shouldn't be tied as closely with nft context.
