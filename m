Another possibility is to remove the existing call to rate_parse().

the bison parser accepts both:

add filter input limit rate 1048576 mbytes / second
add filter input limit rate 1048576 mbytes/second

after your update, right? I'm missing a few deletions in this previous
(the existing rules). I think there's a way to consolidate this bison
rule.
