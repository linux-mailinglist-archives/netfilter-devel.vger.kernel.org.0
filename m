The module parameter or the policy?

The poliy can be changed via the xtables tools.
Given you can have:

*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A FORWARD -j ACCEPT
COMMIT

... which effectily gives a FORWARD ACCEPT policy I'm not sure logging
the policy is useful.

Furthermore, ebtables has polices even for user-defined chains.

See above, I don't think its useful.  If it is needed, its probably best
to define an informational struct containing the policy (accept/drop)
value for the each hook points (prerouting to postrouting),  fill
that from the backend specific code (as thats the only place that
exposes the backend specific structs ...) and then pass that to
the audit logging functions.
